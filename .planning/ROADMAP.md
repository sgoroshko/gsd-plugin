**v1.3 Consistency & Code-Integrity Safeguards (Phases 10-11) — SCOPED 2026-06-26 (active)**

Addresses **cross-session drift**: independent agent sessions, no shared memory, produce
locally-reasonable but globally-inconsistent code (duplicate logic under different names,
oscillating naming conventions, split architectural patterns, half-finished stubs). Two
complementary tracks: prevention stops new drift, detection reconciles existing drift.
Origin: `/gsd:explore` session 2026-06-26. VibeDrift v0.14.0 empirically evaluated on 4 repos
(see [milestones/v1.3-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.3-ROADMAP.md) for findings: adopt as optional
external gate + cherry-pick its heuristics; do not vendor).

- [x] Phase 10: Convention and Architectural Conformance (completed 2026-06-26)
- [x] Phase 11: Drift Detection and Consistency Gate (completed 2026-06-27)

### Phase 10: Convention and Architectural Conformance

**Goal:** Stop a new file from introducing cross-session convention/architectural drift, using
the conventions the codebase already exhibits (derived by majority vote, not hardcoded).

**Requirements:** CONV-01, CONV-02, CONV-03, CONV-04

**Success criteria:**

1. `gsd-pattern-mapper` writes a Conventions section (identifier casing, file-name casing, export style) to PATTERNS.md, derived by majority vote with an entropy signal.
2. `gsd-code-reviewer` flags a deliberately convention-violating changed file and passes a conforming one.
3. Verb-vs-body intent and architectural-split (DI vs env, error-handling) checks run with no new runtime dependency, in the existing review path.

**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md — TDD: bin/lib/conventions.cjs (deriveConventions + checkConformance) + tests/conventions.test.cjs (Wave 0 first)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*

- [x] 10-02-PLAN.md — Wire `verify conventions` JSON subcommand (manifest/alias/router/handler) + CI test job

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2 completion)*

- [x] 10-03-PLAN.md — pattern-mapper Conventions section + code-reviewer CONVENTION tier + code-review.md wiring

### Phase 11: Drift Detection and Consistency Gate

**Goal:** Surface existing cross-session drift repo-wide and gate the pre-1.0 release ceremony.
Detection is 100% native (D-01/D-04 retired the "fallback" framing): three native layers (Phase 10
conventions reuse + phantom/placeholder + MinHash+LCS structural-dup) are the primary sweep, and
VibeDrift is treated as a second upstream whose heuristics are ported and watched, never invoked.

**Depends on:** Phase 10 (reuses the convention-extraction logic as native detection layer 1)

**Requirements:** DRIFT-01, DRIFT-02, DRIFT-03, DRIFT-04, DRIFT-05

**Success criteria:**

1. `audit-milestone` runs an optional, config-gated integrity gate that the intentional CJS<->SDK dual resolver does not trip (allowlist verified, suppressions auditable in the report).
2. `/gsd:scan --drift` produces a ranked drift report on gsd-plugin.
3. Native-primary proven: the sweep runs entirely via native checks (zero runtime dep, VibeDrift never invoked).

**Plans:** 5/5 plans complete

Plans:
**Wave 1**

- [x] 11-01-PLAN.md — TDD: bin/lib/semantic-dup.cjs (MinHash+LCS structural near-clone) + tests + calibration on gsd-plugin
- [x] 11-02-PLAN.md — TDD: bin/lib/phantom-scaffolding.cjs + bin/lib/drift-allowlist.cjs + committed .gsd/drift-allowlist.json + .vibedriftignore + tests
- [x] 11-03-PLAN.md — VibeDrift second-upstream watch (bin/check-vibedrift-release.sh) + README + cron-install checkpoint (autonomous:false)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on 11-01 + 11-02)*

- [x] 11-04-PLAN.md — Wire `verify drift` subcommand (cmdVerifyDrift + router) + CJS<->SDK parity (manifest/aliases/2 config keys/dist rebuild) + CI drift-detectors job

**Wave 3** *(blocked on 11-04)*

- [x] 11-05-PLAN.md — `/gsd:scan --drift` ranked report branch + audit-milestone §5.6 opt-in warn-first Drift Integrity Gate

### v1.3 carried backlog (still deferred, NOT in this milestone)

- **LIFE-02** — staleness threshold detection for HANDOFF.json (resume refuses / warns on stale)
- **LIFE-03** — dedicated `/gsd:checkpoint` skill for manual save (optional; current manual path works via `/gsd:pause-work`)
- **BEHAVIOR-01** — integration tests detect semantic regressions in upstream skills that keep the same name but change behavior (needs integration-test infra)
- **UPST-03** — upstream-PR packaging (blocked on reassessment: is upstream still the right destination given their 1.34→1.38.x trajectory?)
- **UPST-04** — PR-ready diff preparation for upstream submission (blocked on UPST-03)
