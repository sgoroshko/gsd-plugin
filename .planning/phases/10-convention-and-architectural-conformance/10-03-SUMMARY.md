# Phase 10 Plan 03: Convention conformance markdown layer Summary

Surfaced the 10-01 conventions module to its two consuming agents and the review workflow: the pattern-mapper now derives and writes an additive PATTERNS.md `## Conventions` section, and the code-reviewer gained an advisory `CONVENTION` tier plus three standalone JS/TS rule-pack checks, all routed through the SAME `verify conventions` subcommand from 10-02.

## What Was Built

**Task 1 — gsd-pattern-mapper Step 5.5 (commit 169e00d):** Inserted a terse "Derive Conventions" step between Step 5 and Step 6. It resolves `$ROOT` via the standard `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-...}` form, runs `node "$ROOT/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" verify conventions --derive --scope <dir>` via Bash, parses the JSON `axes`, and writes an additive `## Conventions` section to PATTERNS.md: a 4-axis table (file-name casing, identifier casing, export style, import style) with Dominant / Share / Entropy / Status columns (named contract at >=70% dominance, contested hotspot below) plus a contested-hotspot note that names the CJS<->SDK dual resolver as the prototype intentional-contested split (CONV-01, D-01/D-02).

**Task 2 — gsd-code-reviewer CONVENTION tier + 3 checks + workflow wiring (commit 27b0f60):**
- Added a `CONVENTION` tier line to `<adversarial_stance>` ranked below WARNING: advisory consistency deviation, never blocks, never gates, recommend-fix framing (D-03). BLOCKER/WARNING semantics unchanged (additive).
- Added a "Convention checks (CONVENTION tier — JS/TS rule packs)" block to `<depth_levels>` describing the three checks (conformance / verb-vs-body / architectural-split) that run on `.cjs/.js/.mjs/.ts/.tsx` and skip gracefully on no-pack languages (D-05), plus the standalone Bash invocation `verify conventions --check --files "<csv>"` that emits CONVENTION findings into REVIEW.md. Stated explicitly standalone — no dependency on the mapper having run (D-04).
- Added a one-line note to `workflows/code-review.md` (`structural_pre_pass` step) that the reviewer self-invokes the conventions check using the existing resolver, no workflow pre-pass needed.

## Requirements Satisfied

- **CONV-01** — pattern-mapper writes the derived `## Conventions` section (>=70% naming, contested hotspots incl. CJS<->SDK resolver).
- **CONV-02/03/04** — reviewer emits CONVENTION-tier findings for conformance / verb-vs-body / architectural-split via the shared module, standalone (D-04).

## Verification

- Task 1 automated: `grep -q "verify conventions --derive"` + `grep -q "## Conventions"` in pattern-mapper — PASS. `grep "70"` + `CJS<->SDK dual resolver` present — PASS.
- Task 2 automated: `CONVENTION` + `verify conventions --check` in reviewer + `conventions` in code-review.md — PASS. `standalone` (D-04) and `skip gracefully` (D-05) present — PASS. BLOCKER/WARNING counts intact (additive only).
- Sanity: the underlying `node tests/conventions.test.cjs` suite (from 10-01/10-02) passes — markdown edits do not touch the module, but confirms the invoked subcommand path is live.
- Live check: `node bin/gsd-tools.cjs verify conventions --derive --scope bin/lib` and `--check --files ...` both emit valid JSON (the shapes the markdown instructs agents to parse).

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. These were insertion-point markdown edits with no discovered bugs or blocking issues. No packages installed (markdown-only, T-10-SC mitigation holds).

## Threat Model Notes

All threat-register dispositions held without added code: T-10-07 (tier pinned below WARNING, never-block/never-gate stated in the reviewer markdown), T-10-08 (markdown only forwards the existing changed-`files` list; `--files` sanitization lives inside the module from 10-01/10-02), T-10-09 (contested axes reported as hotspots, not dropped), T-10-SC (zero package installs).

## Notes for Next Phase

Phase 11 (detection) reuses the same `bin/lib/conventions.cjs` module for its native fallback; the contested-hotspot list the mapper writes (CJS<->SDK resolver) is the seed for repo-wide drift detection. Manual UAT per VALIDATION.md (a real `/gsd:code-review` run on a convention-violating file surfacing a non-blocking CONVENTION finding) remains a phase-gate check.
