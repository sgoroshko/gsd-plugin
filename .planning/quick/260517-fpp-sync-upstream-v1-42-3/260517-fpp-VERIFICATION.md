# Quick Task 260517-fpp: Upstream GSD v1.42.3 Sync Verification Report

**Task goal:** Sync upstream get-shit-done v1.42.3 into the plugin tree, bump plugin v2.43.2 to v2.43.3, preserve all 4 in-tree patches + 2 SDK source patches + plugin-owned bin/gsd-sdk wrappers + hooks/gsd-shadowing-sdk-detector.js + commands/ exclusion.
**Verified:** 2026-05-17
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No (initial verification)

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
| - | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| 1 | Plugin tree at v2.43.3, all 3 metadata files agree | VERIFIED | `package.json` / `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` / `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` all `"version": "2.43.3"`; zero stale `"2.43.2"` matches in those 3 files |
| 2 | 4 in-tree plugin patches survive | VERIFIED | `bin/lib/core.cjs`: 2x `[PLUGIN PATCH]`, 6x `resolveGsdRoot`, 1x `function getAgentsDir`. `bin/lib/model-catalog.cjs`: 1x `#PLUGIN-MODEL-CATALOG-PATH`. `hooks/gsd-context-monitor.js`: 1x `#PLUGIN-HOOK-CONTEXT-MONITOR`. `bin/gsd-tools.cjs`: 4 dispatch cases (write-phase-memory, checkpoint, hook, migrate) |
| 3 | 2 SDK source patches + 1 consolidated probe survive | VERIFIED | `sdk/src/query/state-project-load.ts`: 1x `[PLUGIN PATCH]`. `sdk/src/query-gsd-tools-path.ts`: 1x. `sdk/src/sdk-package-compatibility.ts`: 2x (consolidated legacyAssetProbes) |
| 4 | Plugin-owned wrappers byte-identical | VERIFIED | sha256: `bin/gsd-sdk = 8177abd6...`, `bin/gsd-sdk.cmd = 1bdafc97...`, `hooks/gsd-shadowing-sdk-detector.js = 1b07f0e1...` (match pre-sync per executor's reported hashes) |
| 5 | commands/ absent | VERIFIED | `ls -d commands/` returns ABSENT |
| 6 | Upstream hooks/ unchanged, plugin hooks/ untouched | VERIFIED | No hooks/ files in sync commit 3947827. Plugin-owned hooks/gsd-shadowing-sdk-detector.js sha256 unchanged |
| 7 | sdk/dist/cli.js >= 1.4 MB with >= 2 CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT matches | VERIFIED | 1,662,564 bytes (gate 1,400,000). 3x `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` matches (gate >=2). Sourcemap header parses `{"version":3,"file":"cli.js","sources":["../src/cli.ts"]...}` (consistent rebuild) |
| 8 | All 3 regression tests pass | VERIFIED | `mcp-stdio-framing`: 8 tools PASS. `workspace-json-integration`: 22/22. `hooks-smoke`: 16/16 (includes v2.43.1 shadowing-sdk-detector cases) |
| 9 | README header refers to GSD 1.42.3 + plugin 2.43.3 | VERIFIED | README.md line 3: `**Based on:** [GSD 1.42.3]...`; line 5: `**Plugin version:** \`2.43.3\``. No stale `1.42.2` in head |
| 10 | CHANGELOG [2.43.3] section dated 2026-05-17, ordered above [2.43.2] | VERIFIED | Line 11: `## [2.43.3] - 2026-05-17  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3)` above line 47: `## [2.43.2] - 2026-05-17`. Section contains required sections (Changed/Fixed/Added/Plugin patches preserved). Em-dash count in [2.43.3] section: 0 |

**Score:** 10/10 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
| -------- | -------- | ------ | ------- |
| `package.json` | `"version": "2.43.3"` | VERIFIED | match |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | `"version": "2.43.3"` | VERIFIED | match |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | `"version": "2.43.3"` | VERIFIED | match |
| `sdk/dist/cli.js` | >= 1.4 MB | VERIFIED | 1,662,564 bytes |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | `## [2.43.3] - 2026-05-17` | VERIFIED | exact match line 11 |
| `README.md` | contains `v1.42.3` | VERIFIED | line 3 |
| `/tmp/namespace-hits.txt` | detection-step artifact | VERIFIED | 50 lines (22-line classification header + 29 raw hit lines), present on disk |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status |
| ---- | -- | --- | ------ |
| `bin/lib/core.cjs` | plugin-flat agents/ | `getAgentsDir` patched + `resolveGsdRoot` exports | WIRED (2 [PLUGIN PATCH] markers + functional landmarks present) |
| `bin/lib/model-catalog.cjs` | sdk/shared/model-catalog.json | flat-layout candidate prepend | WIRED (marker survives auto) |
| `hooks/gsd-context-monitor.js` | `bin/gsd-tools.cjs` | __dirname traversal + GSD_TOOLS_PATH | WIRED (marker survives auto) |
| `sdk/dist/cli.js` | patched sdk/src modules | rebundle preserved CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT candidates | WIRED (3 matches in bundle) |

## Deviation Deep-Dive

### Deviation #1: sdk/dist tree staged wholesale (16 files vs plan's 1)

**Verdict: ACCEPTED — anticipated by plan.**

- Plan's Task 1 NOTE explicitly authorized this ("the v2.43.0 sync deviated by staging sdk/dist/ wholesale").
- Commit 3947827 contains 16 sdk/dist files: cli.js + 5 modules x {.js, .js.map, .d.ts.map} = 1 + 15 = 16. Math checks out.
- Sourcemap header confirms tsc rebuild produced consistent output (`"sources":["../src/cli.ts"]`).
- Working tree post-sync is clean modulo `.planning/`.

### Deviation #2: Task 5 SKIPPED despite 29 namespace-hits.txt entries

**Verdict: ACCEPTED — executor classification confirmed correct via independent spot-check.**

I re-ran the raw detection (`grep -rEn '/gsd-[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*' workflows/`) and got 41 raw hits before any filter. Applied the plan's prose allow-list (paths under `agents/`, `/tmp/gsd-*`, `gsd-tools`, `gsd-sdk`, `gsd-user-files-backup`, `gsd-update-check`, `gsd-worktree`, `gsd-profile-`, `gsd-review-`, `github.com/gsd-build`, `cache/gsd`, `.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-`), and was left with exactly **3 surviving patterns**, all of which I read in context:

| File:Line | Pattern | Context | Classification |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | -------------- |
| workflows/plan-phase.md:103 | `/gsd-research-phase` | "Replaces the **deleted** `/gsd-research-phase` command." | Historical reference to a removed command. MUST PRESERVE (rewriting to `/gsd:research-phase` would invent a nonexistent colon-namespaced command). |
| workflows/plan-phase.md:427 | `/gsd-research-phase` | "Mirrors the **deleted** `/gsd-research-phase` standalone's existing-artifact menu (#3042 parity)." | Same as above. MUST PRESERVE. |
| workflows/execute-phase.md:1742 | `/gsd-transition` | "**IMPORTANT: There is NO `/gsd-transition` command. Never suggest it.**" | Explicit negative reference telling the agent the command does not exist. MUST PRESERVE (rewriting would contradict the warning). |

All 3 are intentional preservation cases. Combined with the executor's 29 (after plan's narrower regex allow-list): 18 Class P (agent .md path refs) + 10 Class T (tempfiles) + 1 Class U (URL fragment in update.md:614 GitHub link) + 0 actual command invocations. **No /gsd-X command-style invocations exist in the synced workflows/ tree that need rewriting to /gsd:X.** Executor's SKIP decision is correct; no commit required.

### Style/quality

- 0 em-dashes introduced in CHANGELOG [2.43.3] section diff (gate clean).
- 0 em-dashes in README head diff (gate clean).
- All 5 phase commits present in master log (3947827, 3636220, 4fd6ff3, 604fa34, plus merge 3b3557c).

### Gaps Summary

None. All 10 must-haves verified with positive codebase evidence. Both reported deviations are sound: Deviation #1 was pre-authorized by plan text; Deviation #2 holds up under independent spot-check of the 3 closest-to-command-shaped patterns in the synced workflows.

## Recommendation

**PROCEED to release.** Plugin tree at v2.43.3, all 4 in-tree patches + 2 SDK source patches + consolidated probe + plugin-owned wrappers + commands/-exclusion all preserved verbatim. SDK bundle rebuilt cleanly. Regression trifecta green. CHANGELOG + README docs in sync.

One process improvement to consider in next sync's plan (not blocking this release): the Task 5 `<verify>` regex allow-list should be widened to match the `<action>` prose allow-list (add `agents/gsd-*\.md` path patterns + `/tmp/gsd-*` tempfile patterns + `github.com/gsd-build` URL fragments) so future executors do not face the same prose-vs-verify gap. Not actionable for this task.
