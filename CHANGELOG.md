# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Plugin version in section brackets; upstream GSD base version in trailing parentheses. See [README § Versioning](./README.md#versioning) for the `plugin_major = upstream_major + 1` scheme.

History before 2.38.2 lives in git + the per-milestone archive (see `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md` and `.planning/milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md`).

## [Unreleased]

## [3.4.1] - 2026-06-09  (follows gsd-core 1.4.x; base = GSD 1.42.3-era + selective cherry-picks)

**Version scheme re-base.** Upstream moved to `@opengsd/gsd-core`, which restarted numbering at `1.x`. This release re-bases the plugin version to track the gsd-core line with a `+2` major offset: gsd-core `1.4.1` -> plugin `3.4.1`. The `+2` (rather than the old `+1`) keeps the version monotonically above the prior `2.45.x` lineage instead of regressing to `2.4.x`. See [README Versioning](./README.md#versioning). This single release bundles the auto-memory feature below and the 5 gsd-core v1.4.x cherry-picks.

New capability: automatic capture of durable decisions during ad-hoc work, so context persists between milestones without the user manually typing "remember".

Background: the plugin previously only auto-wrote memory at planned-phase completion, and that path was doubly broken and never wired into any workflow. The `write-phase-memory` dispatch called `memory.writePhaseMemory` (the export is `cmdWritePhaseMemory`, so it threw `not a function` on every call) and read the phase number from `args[0]` (the command name) instead of `args[1]`. The command was added in April and never invoked by a workflow, so in practice the plugin never auto-captured anything: all memory was manual. This release fixes both bugs and fills the ad-hoc gap.

### Added
- **Ad-hoc durable-decision capture** at the close-out of `/gsd:quick`, `/gsd:debug`, and `/gsd:fast`, gated on `workflow.auto_memory_capture` (default `true`). The orchestrating model judges whether a durable decision emerged (a hard preference, a non-obvious rationale, a resolved-bug root cause) and, if so, writes one memory and surfaces a single `Saved memory: <slug>` line. Conservative by design: most ad-hoc tasks capture nothing.
- **`bin/lib/memory.cjs`**: `cmdWriteDecisionMemory` + `appendDecisionIndex`. The model composes the body (durability is a judgment call); the helper resolves the auto-memory path (handling worktree-shared and remote memory dirs), writes `<slug>.md` with consistent frontmatter idempotently, and flat-indexes it in `MEMORY.md` matching the hand-curated one-line style.
- **`bin/gsd-tools.cjs`**: new plugin-only `write-decision-memory` dispatch (flag-parsed `--slug/--title/--description/--type/--body-file`).
- **`references/auto-memory-capture.md`**: shared protocol (config gate, conservative durability test, dedup-before-write, one-line notice) referenced by all three ad-hoc workflows.
- **`tests/auto-memory-capture.test.cjs`**: 23 checks (write + flat index + idempotency, the two phase-memory regressions, and the workflow wiring). Full suite now 10/10.

### Fixed
- **`bin/gsd-tools.cjs` `write-phase-memory`**: now calls `cmdWritePhaseMemory` (was the undefined `writePhaseMemory`) and reads the phase number from `args[1]` (was `args[0]`, the command name). The command was orphaned (never wired into a workflow), so neither bug had surfaced.

### Fixed (cherry-picks from gsd-core v1.4.x)
- **`bin/lib/state.cjs`** (upstream #905, `e0f67c75`): `syncStateFrontmatter` and `cmdStateJson` now preserve `current_phase` / `current_phase_name` / `current_plan` (plus `stopped_at` / `paused_at` / `progress`) from the existing frontmatter when the body lacks those annotations, instead of silently dropping them on rewrite. A real STATE.md data-loss fix, extending the plugin's state-preservation lineage.
- **`bin/lib/init.cjs` + `bin/lib/commands.cjs`** (upstream #904, `bf77c0b2`): normalize the phase token in the `phase_branch_template` so a set `project_code` no longer leaks into branch names (`gsd/phase-CK-01-foo` -> `gsd/phase-01-foo`), which broke branch resolution and could spawn duplicate branches.
- **`agents/` (14 agents)** (upstream #771, `3aed0282`): `color:` frontmatter values changed from hex/`magenta` to the 8 documented Claude Code named colors, so per-agent TUI coloring actually renders.
- **`agents/gsd-verifier.md`** (upstream #25, `ad1203f9`): Step 7b now proves a test EXISTS by enumeration (`--list` / `--collect-only`) and one PASSES by name, and forbids more than one full-suite run per verification, stopping the cross-language full-suite re-runs (`cargo`/`pytest`/`go`) that wasted minutes per must-have.
- **`workflows/plan-phase.md`** (upstream #913, `bb27263d`): adds a `<runtime_compatibility>` block (the Agent tool is available top-level; never collapse researcher/planner/checker roles inline; `--chain`/`--auto` suppress prompts only) and relabels all 7 orchestrator-rule markers from `CODEX RUNTIME` to `ALL RUNTIMES`. The `execute-phase` background-dispatch scoping is deferred (it crosses a plugin divergence).

## [2.45.10] - 2026-06-08  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, with 5 cherry-picks from upstream v1.3.1)

Selective cherry-pick of five verified bug fixes from upstream's v1.0.0..v1.3.1 range, ported by hand into the flat layout. This is NOT a wholesale sync: a routine "sync to v1.3.1" investigation found upstream had restructured heavily (build-at-publish for `bin/lib`, the SDK retired, and a second rename to `@opengsd/gsd-core` at repo `open-gsd/gsd-core`), making a full vendor-and-merge a ~350-file migration. We pulled only the portable, low-risk wins instead.

Note on the gsd-core convergence question: upstream now ships its own native Claude Code plugin manifest (#766), but only on `next`, not in v1.3.1. Our manifest remains authoritative (it is a strict superset, adding the MCP server, a churn-resilient hook resolver, and the no-bundled-commands design); convergence is parked until #766 reaches a stable tag.

### Fixed
- **`agents/` (7 writer agents)** (upstream #582 `692343f8`, #571 `c2ebb1ba`): `gsd-eval-planner`, `gsd-ai-researcher`, `gsd-domain-researcher`, `gsd-phase-researcher`, `gsd-ui-researcher`, `gsd-debug-session-manager`, and `gsd-doc-writer` shipped with `Write` but no `Edit`. Their prompts call for surgical in-place section edits on shared files, so with no `Edit` tool they silently fell back to whole-file `Write`, clobbering sibling sections (last-writer-wins) while reporting success. Added `Edit` to all seven. `gsd-doc-writer` fix mode + critical_rules were rewritten to mandate `Edit` and forbid `Write` on existing files, and `workflows/docs-update.md` gained a post-fix >90%-shrink restore guard.
- **`bin/lib/commands.cjs`** (upstream #387 `bd98e568`, fixes #308): the Brave web-search `fetch()` had no timeout, so a hung connection blocked the agent indefinitely. Wrapped it in a per-attempt `AbortController` timeout (configurable via `GSD_WEBSEARCH_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 10s) plus a 2-retry loop for 429/5xx that honors `Retry-After` (capped at 60s). Non-429 4xx fail immediately.
- **`workflows/plan-phase.md`** (upstream #283 `ce945ef7`, fixes #275): the decision-coverage gate parsed only `.data.passed`/`.data.message`; it now reads `(.passed // .data.passed)` with a message fallback, tolerating top-level result fields from the CLI so the gate cannot silently mis-fire.
- **`workflows/{new-project,settings-advanced,settings-integrations}.md`** (upstream #243 `b2a8411e`, fixes #17): `AskUserQuestion` blocks that exceeded Claude Code's 4-option runtime cap (the settings-change multiselect, the runtime selector, and the review/agent-skills pickers) are now split into gated two-block flows, so options are no longer silently truncated.

## [2.45.9] - 2026-05-29  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Behavior change addressing a real felt issue: in larger projects, GSD-managed milestones tend toward unbounded growth because the architecture has 4 workflows that add phases (`add-phase`, `insert-phase`, `add-backlog`, `plan-milestone-gaps`) against 1 that effectively closes them (`complete-milestone`). When `gsd-verifier` returns `gaps_found`, the historical default was to route the gaps into a follow-up phase via `/gsd:plan-phase --gaps`. That kept gap-driven phase multiplication going indefinitely.

This release flips the default. When `gaps_found`, the orchestrator now asks the user how to handle the gaps with three options: **Park to backlog** (recommended, gaps become 999.x backlog entries via `/gsd:add-backlog`, milestone ships when remaining in-scope phases close), **Escalate to current milestone** (gaps become a follow-up phase via `/gsd:plan-phase --gaps`, current behavior preserved), or **Decide later** (just print the summary, no action). The "Park to backlog" option is presented as the recommended default because most gaps are legitimately follow-up work, not blockers, and parking them surfaces the scope decision at the next milestone planning gate rather than mid-flight.

Why this matters: this project's own milestones (v1.0, v1.1, v1.2) all shipped at 3, 2, 3 phases with zero decimal-numbered inserts, which only works because the maintainer actively scope-polices. Larger team projects can't lean on a single judgment-bearer the same way, so the architectural bias toward addition becomes load-bearing.

Tradeoff: looser scope discipline. Teams that WANT exhaustive coverage and want every gap to close before milestone ship will prefer the previous default. They can still pick "Escalate to current milestone" on any individual gaps_found event. A config flag (`workflow.gaps_default_action: park | escalate`) is plausible if requests come in; not shipped yet.

Also bundled: the test stability commit from `834fa51` that landed unreleased on 2026-05-29 (refactor of `tests/mcp-write-tools-end-to-end.test.cjs` to drop the 6-sequential-spawn check, keeping `gsd_add_blocker` end-to-end + `gsd_plan_status` control case). 20/20 deterministic.

### Changed
- **`workflows/execute-phase.md`** verify_phase_goal step: `gaps_found` handling now presents an `AskUserQuestion` with three options ("Park to backlog (Recommended)", "Escalate to current milestone", "Decide later") instead of unconditionally routing to `/gsd:plan-phase --gaps`. Park-to-backlog runs `/gsd:add-backlog` for each gap and marks the phase as `gaps_parked` so the milestone can ship when remaining in-scope phases close. The escalation path is unchanged from the previous behavior.
- **`agents/gsd-verifier.md`**: softened the "Structure gaps for `/gsd:plan-phase --gaps`" guidance in 3 places to mention both downstream paths (backlog and escalation), so the verifier no longer pre-biases the orchestrator's routing choice.

### Fixed
- **`tests/mcp-write-tools-end-to-end.test.cjs`** (from unreleased commit `834fa51`): dropped the racy "all 6 write tools in one server" check. Each MCP write tool's spawnSync of `bin/gsd-tools.cjs` takes 1-3 seconds (node startup cost), so 6 sequential calls hit the test budget. Kept `gsd_add_blocker actually mutates STATE.md` + `gsd_plan_status (control)` which together preserve the regression signal for #11. 20/20 deterministic.

## [2.45.8] - 2026-05-29  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Test stability fix for `tests/mcp-write-tools-end-to-end.test.cjs`. The v2.45.5 fix routes each MCP write-tool call through a `spawnSync('node', ['bin/gsd-tools.cjs', 'state', '<subcommand>'])` subprocess. The end-to-end test sends 6 sequential write-tool calls in one case, which means 6 sequential node-subprocess spawns inside the MCP server, each ~100-200ms. The test's original 1.5s post-request window was too tight: 5 of 5 local runs at v2.45.7 ship produced 1-2 of 3 passes instead of 3 of 3. Bumped the post-request wait to 5s and the overall test timeout to 15s. 5 of 5 runs now pass deterministically. The MCP server behavior itself is unchanged; this is purely a test budget adjustment.

### Fixed
- **`tests/mcp-write-tools-end-to-end.test.cjs`**: `POST_REQUEST_WAIT_MS` raised from 1500 to 5000, `TIMEOUT_MS` from 8000 to 15000, kill-after-stdin-end from 300ms to 500ms. CI determinism restored.

## [2.45.7] - 2026-05-29  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Cuts the per-quick-task commit count roughly in half. The historical pattern was a "feat: do X" work commit followed by a "docs(quick-NN): X" docs commit immediately after, with the same description and the same blast radius. Measurement at v2.45.6 ship: 27 `docs(quick-NN)` commits in the previous 30 days, each one piggybacking on a feature commit above it. Humans reading git log saw twice the noise per task.

The fix is surgical: in `workflows/quick.md` Step 8, fold the docs into the preceding work commit via `git commit --amend --no-edit` when it is safe to do so. Safety conditions: the executor produced at least one new commit this run (HEAD differs from the EXPECTED_BASE captured before Step 6), HEAD is not a merge commit (avoids amending onto worktree-merge commits in worktree mode), `commit_docs` is true, and there are docs actually staged. When any condition fails, falls back to the original separate-commit behavior so worktree flows and `commit_docs: false` projects are unaffected.

What this means in practice: a single `/gsd:quick` task on a non-worktree project (the common case, including this plugin where `.planning/` is gitignored) now produces one commit instead of two. The commit message of the work commit stays the same; the docs files (PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, STATE.md) just ride along with the code change.

Tradeoff to weigh: amend rewrites the most recent commit hash. If a CI run already started against that hash before the amend, the rewrite invalidates it. In practice this is safe because the amend happens within a single `/gsd:quick` invocation before any push.

Deferred for scope: `workflows/execute-phase.md` has 5 separate commit emission sites (wave-tracking, UAT gap closure, HUMAN-UAT persistence, phase complete, todo auto-close) which together produce many commits per phase. Each has different semantics, so they get their own pass in a future release. Also deferred: the pre-dispatch PLAN.md commit and the worktree-merge commit, both of which are load-bearing for the worktree isolation contract and would need coordinated changes.

### Changed
- **`workflows/quick.md` Step 8**: amend docs into the preceding work commit when safe instead of emitting a separate `docs(quick-NN): ...` commit. Fall back to the original behavior when amend would be unsafe (no new work commit, HEAD is a merge commit, `commit_docs: false`, or nothing staged). Commit count for a single `/gsd:quick` task drops from 2 commits to 1 in the common case.

## [2.45.6] - 2026-05-29  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Nudges the `gsd-executor` agent's bias toward self-testing instead of asking the user. The agent prompt at `agents/gsd-executor.md:306` historically declared that `checkpoint:human-verify` should fire on ~90% of executor checkpoints. In practice this trained the executor to default to "can you verify X?" prompts even when the verification had a plausible automation path (file existence, grep, command exit code, test run). Lowering the declared share to 40% leaves 40% + 9% (decision) + 1% (human-action) = 50%, with the implicit remainder being silent automated checks the executor performs without emitting a checkpoint at all. That is the behavior shift: more self-testing, fewer interruptions for the user.

Why 40 specifically: a starting point we can tune later. If users observe the executor self-testing things it should not have (false positives), bump to 50 or 60. If users still feel over-prompted, drop to 30. The number is a knob, not a measurement; the value of the change is the bias signal, not the precise threshold.

Tradeoff to weigh: an executor that self-tests on a flawed automation (regex passes but semantics are wrong) could ship broken code with a green status. Mitigation: the executor already logs the exact commands it ran in commit bodies and SUMMARY.md, so spot-checks are cheap. We will revisit if the false-positive rate becomes observable.

### Changed
- **`agents/gsd-executor.md` line 306**: `checkpoint:human-verify (90%)` to `checkpoint:human-verify (40%)`. Sibling checkpoint types (`decision (9%)`, `human-action (1%)`) left untouched. The non-summing distribution (50% total declared) is intentional: it tells the executor that the remaining ~50% of checkpoints are silent automated checks, not user prompts.

## [2.45.5] - 2026-05-29  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Fixes [#11](https://github.com/jnuyens/gsd-plugin/issues/11) reported by @tinmanlab (Hyeonseok Seong): all six MCP write tools (`gsd_advance_plan`, `gsd_record_metric`, `gsd_add_decision`, `gsd_add_blocker`, `gsd_resolve_blocker`, `gsd_record_session`) returned the misleading "state module not available" error for every call. The read tool `gsd_plan_status` was unaffected, which is why this slipped past most users (BashTool consumers use the `gsd-sdk query state.*` path which always worked).

## Root cause (two-layer drift)

The `bin/lib/state.cjs` module was refactored to expose `cmdStateX` (e.g. `cmdStateAdvancePlan`) but `mcp/server.cjs` still referenced the pre-refactor names `cmdX` (e.g. `cmdAdvancePlan`). The guard `if (state && state.cmdAdvancePlan)` evaluated false because the export was undefined, so the handler short-circuited to the "state module not available" branch. Even with names aliased, the in-process call would still fail because the handlers used a `process.argv`-mutation + `captureCmd` pattern that the refactored functions do not support. The refactored API expects explicit `(cwd, options, raw)` arguments.

A secondary issue: `bin/lib/core.cjs::output()` writes via `fs.writeSync(1, ...)` directly to file descriptor 1 to dodge the `process.exit` flush race. This bypasses `process.stdout.write` interception, so any in-process capture approach is fundamentally unreliable for state-library output.

## The fix

Replaced the in-process `captureCmd(state.cmdX)` dance with `spawnSync('node', ['bin/gsd-tools.cjs', 'state', '<subcommand>', '--raw', ...])`. This routes through `bin/lib/state-command-router.cjs` (the canonical argv-shape router) which dispatches to `state.cmdStateX(cwd, options, raw)`. MCP consumers now run through the exact same code path as direct CLI use, eliminating future drift. The spawn pattern matches the existing `gsd_commit_docs` handler.

Per the v2.45.0 state-handler preservation contract, `gsd_record_session` omits `--resume-file` when the caller does not pass one, so the existing `Resume File` value is preserved instead of being clobbered to literal `None`.

Thanks to @tinmanlab for the unusually thorough diagnosis. They cited the exact files, line numbers, and the calling-convention drift on first read.

### Fixed
- **`mcp/server.cjs`**: 6 MCP write tool handlers now route through `bin/gsd-tools.cjs state <subcommand>` via `spawnSync`, fixing the state-library API mismatch from the v2.42.x state.cjs refactor. New end-to-end regression test at `tests/mcp-write-tools-end-to-end.test.cjs` drives the MCP server as a child process, asserts no "state module not available" responses, and confirms `gsd_add_blocker` actually mutates STATE.md on disk. Wired into CI as a new `mcp-write-tools` job.
- **`bin/maintenance/pre-commit-drift-baseline.sh`**: the v2.45.4 jargon-ratchet block was unreachable because the file-layout PASS path had an early `exit 0` above it. Restructured as an explicit `if/else` so the jargon detector now runs unconditionally on every commit. Verified by injecting a `.planning/` reference into README.md, confirming the hook aborts, then reverting and confirming it passes.

## [2.45.4] - 2026-05-29  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Adds a CI guard that catches GSD-jargon leaks into the plugin's own user-facing documentation (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`). Scope is PLUGIN SELF ONLY. The guard does NOT police downstream user-project docs because downstream projects can legitimately use phase numbers and plan IDs for their own domain reasons (chemistry phase transitions, deployment phases, project-management methodologies, etc.). Policing user projects would be presumptuous and would generate noise.

The detector mirrors the existing file-layout drift detector: counts-based ratchet, baseline lives at `tests/drift-baseline.json` under a new `user_docs_jargon` section, regenerate with `--write-baseline` when a legitimate addition lands. Fenced code blocks are stripped before scanning so `/gsd:` command examples and file-path examples in `bash` blocks do NOT pollute the ratchet.

Design note: the pre-commit hook deliberately does NOT auto-regen the jargon baseline on regression (unlike the file-layout detector, which auto-regens benign growth). Auto-regen would defeat the catch. The point is to make the author pause, confirm the new mention was intentional, then explicitly run `--write-baseline`. That moment of explicit acknowledgment is the whole feature.

### Added
- **`bin/maintenance/check-user-docs-jargon.cjs`**: counts-based ratchet detector with four pattern categories (`planning_paths`, `artifact_names`, `plan_files`, `generic_phase_num`). Mirrors `check-file-layout.cjs` conventions: `--write-baseline`, `--dry`, requires repo root with `.git/` + `skills/`.
- **`tests/user-docs-jargon.test.cjs`**: 4-case discrimination test (clean fixture passes, injected jargon fails, code-block-stripped jargon is ignored, baseline write preserves the sibling `file_layout` section).
- **`tests/drift-baseline.json`**: new `user_docs_jargon` section with current counts captured as legitimate (36 planning_paths, 41 artifact_names, 3 plan_files, 17 generic_phase_num at v2.45.4 ship).
- **`.github/workflows/check-drift.yml`**: new `user-docs-jargon` job running the detector and the discrimination test on every push and PR.
- **`bin/maintenance/pre-commit-drift-baseline.sh`**: extended to fail-loud when the jargon ratchet regresses, with a clear message telling the author how to regenerate the baseline or override.

## [2.45.3] - 2026-05-29  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Adds regression tests for three plugin-flat-layout patches that have been wiped or contested across past upstream sync cycles. Principle: only test patches that have already broken (paying down debt), not speculative coverage. Each new test discriminates: temporarily reverting the patch produces failures, restoring restores green. Total +9 cases, 3 new files, single commit.

### Changed
- **`tests/getagentsdir-plugin-layout.test.cjs`** (3 cases): regression for `#PLUGIN-AGENTS-DIR` in `bin/lib/core.cjs::getAgentsDir`. Covers env override priority, plugin-flat-layout `agents/` detection via `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, and upstream-traversal fallback when the plugin marker is absent. Without this test, a sync that wipes the patch silently produces `agents_installed: false` warnings on every new project.
- **`tests/model-catalog-resolver-flat-layout.test.cjs`** (3 cases): regression for `#PLUGIN-MODEL-CATALOG-PATH` in `bin/lib/model-catalog.cjs`. Verifies the prepended flat-layout candidate (`bin/lib/__dirname` to `sdk/shared/model-catalog.json` via the patched `..` traversal) resolves successfully, the catalog exposes Anthropic-compatible runtime tiers, and the resolver tolerates a bogus `GSD_MODEL_CATALOG` env override.
- **`tests/phase-deps-on-case-insensitive-cjs.test.cjs`** (3 cases): regression for `#PLUGIN-DEPS-ON-CASE-INSENSITIVE` in `bin/lib/phase.cjs`. The SDK TypeScript side has its own coverage at `sdk/src/query/phase.test.ts`, but the CJS parallel path that the runtime actually executes had no direct test until now. Drives `bin/gsd-tools.cjs phase-plan-index` against tempdir fixtures with lowercase, uppercase, and mixed-case `depends_on` declarations; asserts the wave layout puts dependents into the correct downstream wave. Sanity-verified by reverting the three `toLowerCase()` patch points and confirming 1/3 cases pass (uppercase-canonical only).

## [2.45.2] - 2026-05-29  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Fixes a noisy-resume regression on cold-start after auto-compact. When PreCompact fired in an idle session (between milestones, before any active phase, or after a STATE.md parse failure), the resulting `HANDOFF.json` had `phase: null` and `task: null` (the schema-valid skeleton from `bin/lib/checkpoint.cjs`), but the SessionStart hook unconditionally emitted a `Phase: unknown, Plan: ?, Task: ?` resume nudge plus the "Do this immediately without waiting for user input" directive. Wasteful and confusing on every cold-start in idle projects.

Thanks to @dboeckenhoff (PR [#12](https://github.com/jnuyens/gsd-plugin/pull/12)) for the diagnosis and fix.

### Fixed
- **`bin/gsd-tools.cjs` session-start hook**: skips the resume system message when the `HANDOFF.json` shape is trivial (`phase === null && task === null`). Legacy or missing-field shapes (`undefined !== null` is true) still emit, so the guard is safe-by-default on unknown handoff shapes. Regression test added at `tests/session-start-skip-trivial-handoff.test.cjs` covers 6 cases (the new null-null silence path, both populated-fields paths, the legacy/missing-field path, and the no-handoff-at-all path).

## [2.45.1] - 2026-05-29  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Tracks Anthropic's 2026-05-28 release of `claude-opus-4-8`. Drop-in ID bump across the four Anthropic-compatible runtimes (`claude`, `opencode`, `copilot`, `hermes`); pricing parity with 4.7. Effort controls (`high`/`xhigh`/`max`) and Fast Mode integration are a separate, larger piece of work (tracked upstream as open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux#443) and are NOT included here.

### Changed
- **`sdk/shared/model-catalog.json`**: `runtimeTierDefaults.{claude,opencode,copilot,hermes}.opus.model` now `claude-opus-4-8` (or `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8` for the `anthropic/`-prefixed runtimes). Sonnet and Haiku unchanged.
- **`workflows/settings-advanced.md`**: tier table updated for the same four runtimes.
- **`workflows/execute-phase.md`**: example model reference updated.
- **`README.md`**: "Added features beyond upstream" table notes the bump.

### Not changed
- Test fixtures hardcoded to historical IDs (`sdk/src/*.test.ts`, `sdk/src/runtime-gate.ts`, `sdk/src/types.ts`) are intentional and left as-is.
- Non-Anthropic runtime defaults (`codex`, `gemini`, `qwen`) track their own vendor cadences.
- Effort-control / fast-mode schema. See open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux#443.

## [2.45.0] - 2026-05-27  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Fixes [#9](https://github.com/jnuyens/gsd-plugin/issues/9) reported by @jasonburks23: SDK state handlers (`state.advance-plan`, `state.record-session`, `state.planned-phase`) were overwriting executor-authored STATE.md content with template defaults. Data-loss-shape bug: rich `last_activity`, narrative `Status`, contextual `Stopped at`, and executor-set `Resume file` pointers all got clobbered when the post-execution handlers ran.

Minor version bump because the state-handler contract changed (the handlers now preserve executor-authored content under a defined ownership table, not just blindly overwrite).

### Fixed
- **`sdk/src/query/state-mutation.ts` `stateAdvancePlan`**: stopped unconditionally overwriting `Status` and `Last Activity` with `'Ready to execute'` / `today`. Now uses `stateReplaceFieldIfTemplate` which preserves the existing value if it's not a known template default. Structural fields (`Plan: N of M`, frontmatter progress) still owned by the handler unconditionally.
- **`sdk/src/query/state-mutation.ts` `stateRecordSession`**: removed the `?? 'None'` default for `--resume-file`. When the caller does NOT pass `--resume-file`, the existing Resume File value is preserved (no more clobber to literal `'None'`). When the caller DOES pass `--resume-file`, behavior is unchanged (caller authority wins). Same treatment for `--stopped-at`.
- **`sdk/src/query/state-mutation.ts` `statePlannedPhase`**: same preservation treatment for `Status`, `Last Activity`, and `Last Activity Description`. `Total Plans in Phase` remains handler-owned.
- **`sdk/src/query/state-mutation.ts` `updateCurrentPositionFields` helper**: applies the same preservation to the body-text `## Current Position` section's `Status` and `Last activity` lines. `Plan: N of M` summary line still handler-owned.

### Added
- **`sdk/src/query/state-document.ts` `KNOWN_TEMPLATE_DEFAULTS` set**: the values the handlers historically write (`'Ready to execute'`, the em-dash and ASCII-hyphen variants of `'Phase complete - ready for verification'`, `'unknown'`, `'None'`, `'TBD'`, empty string). Plus bare ISO dates and ISO timestamps with no descriptive suffix.
- **`sdk/src/query/state-document.ts` `isStateTemplateDefault(value)` predicate**: checks a string against the set.
- **`sdk/src/query/state-document.ts` `stateReplaceFieldIfTemplate()` and `stateReplaceFieldIfTemplateWithFallback()` helpers**: the new safe-replace primitives. Return a `{ content, outcome }` object so callers know whether the field was replaced, preserved, or not found. Existing `stateReplaceField` / `stateReplaceFieldWithFallback` retained for handlers that legitimately own a field unconditionally.
- **Regression tests** in `sdk/src/query/state-mutation.test.ts` (7 new cases, 93 total now, up from 86):
  - `stateAdvancePlan` preserves executor-authored Status with rich context
  - `stateAdvancePlan` overwrites template-default Status (`'Ready to execute'`)
  - `stateAdvancePlan` preserves Last Activity with descriptive suffix
  - `stateAdvancePlan` overwrites bare-date Last Activity (template shape)
  - `stateRecordSession` preserves Resume File when `--resume-file` not passed
  - `stateRecordSession` overwrites Resume File when `--resume-file` IS passed (caller authority)
  - `stateRecordSession` preserves Resume File when other args passed but not `--resume-file`

### Field-ownership contract (the new behavior)

| Field | Handler-owned (always overwrite) | Executor-owned (preserve unless template) |
|---|---|---|
| Frontmatter `percent`, `progress.*`, `last_updated` ISO | ✅ | |
| Body progress bar `[██░░] 50%` | ✅ | |
| Body "Plan: N of M" summary line | ✅ | |
| Body "Last session" timestamp | ✅ | |
| `Status` field | only when matching `KNOWN_TEMPLATE_DEFAULTS` | otherwise (preserved) |
| `Last Activity` / `last_activity` field | only when matching `KNOWN_TEMPLATE_DEFAULTS` or bare-date | otherwise (preserved) |
| `Last Activity Description` | only when matching `KNOWN_TEMPLATE_DEFAULTS` | otherwise (preserved) |
| `stopped_at` frontmatter / body `Stopped at` | only when caller passes `--stopped-at` | otherwise (preserved) |
| `Resume File` / `Resume file` | only when caller passes `--resume-file` | otherwise (preserved) |
| Narrative Current Position lines beyond Status/Last activity/Plan | never | always preserved |

### Migration / behavior change notes

If your project's STATE.md previously had `Status: Ready to execute` (template default) and you ran a workflow that calls `state.advance-plan`, the behavior is the same as before: the field gets updated. The change is ONLY visible when the existing value is non-template content (i.e., the executor wrote something rich there).

If a downstream workflow was secretly relying on the `?? 'None'` default to clear a stale Resume File pointer, that's now a no-op when `--resume-file` is omitted. To explicitly clear: pass `--resume-file None` (literal value). To set a new pointer: pass `--resume-file <new-path>`.

### Acknowledgments
Thanks @jasonburks23 for the detailed report with the full diff showing what each handler clobbered, the three workarounds you'd already considered, and the suggested fix direction (Option 2: field ownership). Made this a "build the agreed contract" task instead of an "investigate the bug" task.

### Upstream
- Same handlers exist verbatim in `open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux/sdk/src/query/state-mutation.ts`. Will file as a fix-track bug issue with the same proposed diff + new helper functions + test cases. Sibling-track to [#138](https://github.com/open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux/issues/138), [#160](https://github.com/open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux/issues/160), [#163](https://github.com/open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux/issues/163), [#222](https://github.com/open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux/issues/222).

## [2.44.6] - 2026-05-27  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Fixes [#8](https://github.com/jnuyens/gsd-plugin/issues/8): `/gsd:update` was 404ing because workflows referenced the unscoped `get-shit-done-redux` npm package name instead of the actual scoped `@opengsd/get-shit-done-redux`. Reported by @chendrizzy with a complete patch attached. Thank you.

### Background

The v2.43.6 upstream switch renamed `get-shit-done-cc` to `get-shit-done-redux` across docs, but the npm package actually lives at the scoped name `@opengsd/get-shit-done-redux`. The bundled `bin/check-latest-version.cjs` correctly encoded the scoped name (per a comment explaining it was made a constant *specifically* to prevent LLM-driven misuse of wrong-shaped names), but the workflow-side install commands drifted. Result: `/gsd:update` would reach the install step and 404 on the npm registry.

### Fixed
- **`workflows/update.md`**: four call sites at L329 (manual-install hint), L530 (LOCAL install), L535 (GLOBAL install), L540 (UNKNOWN-fallback install). All now use `@opengsd/get-shit-done-redux@latest`. Patch matches the upstream-tree form exactly.
- **`workflows/new-project.md` L89**: `npx @opengsd/get-shit-done-redux@latest --global` in the agents-not-installed remediation hint.
- **`workflows/new-milestone.md` L238**: same hint, scoped.
- **`workflows/help.md` L21, L579**: install-method docs + the comparison line.
- **`workflows/quick.md` L132**: install-fallback hint when `gsd-sdk` is missing.
- **`README.md`**: Pre-install uninstall list (added the scoped name as a new line), "For users of upstream GSD" reference, comparison table.

### Notes
- The unscoped form `npm uninstall -g get-shit-done-redux` is retained in the Pre-install uninstall list as a clean-up sweep for users who tried installing the unscoped name during the v2.43.6 to v2.44.5 window (it 404s, so nothing was installed, but the uninstall is harmless).
- The bin name `get-shit-done-redux` (without scope prefix) is unchanged: the scoped package registers its CLI entry under that bare name. So `npx -y --package=@opengsd/get-shit-done-redux@latest -- get-shit-done-redux --global` is the correct invocation form.

### Acknowledgments
Thanks @chendrizzy for the issue report with a turnkey patch.

### Upstream
- Upstream `open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux` already has the correct scoped form at all call sites. This is a downstream-only drift fix; no upstream issue needed.

## [2.44.5] - 2026-05-25  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Auth-recipe memory: GSD now auto-detects when you authenticate to external systems and lets you save the recipe for future sessions and future projects. User report: "can you add auto-remembering how to connect to other systems or how to gain access to certain accounts?"

Three components shipped together (the user explicitly picked the "Full" scope from a four-option menu rather than incremental phases):

### Added
- **`hooks/gsd-auth-detector.js`** PostToolUse hook on Bash invocations. Pattern-matches against 18 auth-shaped command shapes (`gh auth login`, `aws configure`, `gcloud auth login`, `vault login`, `ssh-keygen`, `git config user.signingkey`, env-var assignments like `export *_TOKEN=*`, platform CLIs like `heroku login` / `fly login` / `netlify login` / `vercel login` / `supabase login` / `firebase login` / `railway login`, etc.). On match: writes a sanitized JSON line to `.planning/.pending-auth-captures.jsonl` (the inbox). Hooks cannot use AskUserQuestion, so the inbox pattern lets the user review at their convenience instead of being interrupted inline.
- **Secret redaction in the detector**. Before any inbox write, the command line is run through redaction rules: `--token=X` / `--password=X` / `--api-key=X` style flags get the value replaced with `[REDACTED]`; env-var assignments to credential-named vars get the value replaced; long base64-ish tokens (40+ chars) get masked; AWS access keys (`AKIA*`, `ASIA*`) get masked; GitHub PATs (`ghp_*`, `gho_*`, etc.) get masked. The inbox stores the SHAPE of the command, never the secret.
- **`skills/remember-access/SKILL.md`** + **`workflows/remember-access.md`**: new `/gsd:remember-access` skill with two modes. Manual capture (`/gsd:remember-access <system>`) walks the user through documenting auth method, setup commands, credential locations, verification command, and freeform notes. Inbox review (`/gsd:remember-access --review`) surfaces each pending detection and lets the user confirm-and-save or discard per entry. Confirmed recipes go to `.planning/AUTH-RECIPES.md` (per-project) and optionally `~/.claude/auth-recipes/<system>.md` (cross-project, survives across new projects).
- **PostToolUse hook registration** in `hooks/hooks.json` for the auth detector. Follows the same plugin-version-fallback Node inline resolver pattern as the other hooks.

### Changed
- **`README.md` `## Added features beyond upstream` table**: two new rows. `/gsd:remember-access` (v2.44.5) and `/gsd:new-ddd` updated to reference `docs/SPEC.md` instead of legacy `DOCS.md`. Also added the v2.44.4 auto-approve row that was missed in the previous release.

### Privacy notes

The hook never stores secret values. The redaction rules are conservative (over-redact rather than miss). If a command shape gets redacted that you wanted to capture, you can re-enter the raw command during the `/gsd:remember-access --review` flow — the auto-detected inbox entry is a starting point, not the final recipe.

The user-global file at `~/.claude/auth-recipes/<system>.md` is NOT committed to git. It lives outside the project repo so credential-adjacent metadata does not leak through public repos.

### Held for future releases
- Workflow integration: workflows that hit auth-likely operations (`gh api`, `aws s3`, etc.) could surface the relevant recipe before the operation fails on missing credentials. Not in v2.44.5; deferred until usage patterns are clearer.
- Recipe-driven auto-execute: GSD could replay a recipe automatically (with user confirmation) when fresh credentials are needed. High value, higher risk of doing the wrong thing; held.
- More auth patterns: the initial 18 patterns cover the common cases. Add more as users report missed detections.

### Upstream
- Plugin-native concept. Will file as upstream enhancement once the pattern stabilizes through real-project use.

## [2.44.4] - 2026-05-25  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Removes two AFK-blocking approval prompts on non-critical artifact drafts. When the user invokes `/gsd:new-project` or `/gsd:new-ddd` and walks away, the workflow no longer waits indefinitely on a yes-answer for the roadmap or SPEC.md draft. Auto-decisions are logged to a new `.planning/AUTO-DECISIONS.md` file the user can spot-check.

### Background

User report: "if then gsd-plugin comes back to ask for a relatively stupid 'ok to proceed', the end user needs to wait before the system continues, losing valuable total project time." The fix is to skip the prompt for non-critical artifacts (ROADMAP draft, SPEC.md draft) where the user retains full ability to intervene after the fact by editing the artifact or re-invoking the workflow.

Investigated implementing a 5-minute interactive keyboard timeout but Claude Code's Bash tool does not expose stdin to spawned commands, so the obvious `read -t 300` pattern is not feasible. Auto-proceed with prominent logging is the closest workable shape and addresses the actual AFK pain.

### Added
- **`workflow.auto_approve_non_critical` config field** (default `true`). When `true`, approval prompts classified as non-critical are skipped and auto-approved. Set to `false` to restore the old prompt-everything behavior.
- **`.planning/AUTO-DECISIONS.md` file** auto-created on first auto-decision. Markdown table with `| Timestamp | Workflow | Decision | Artifact |` rows. User reviews periodically to spot-check; can revert any artifact and re-run the workflow if disagreement found.

### Changed
- **`workflows/new-project.md` ROADMAP approval gate**: new "Auto-approve gate (non-critical artifact)" subsection added before the existing AskUserQuestion logic. When config is `true` (default), the workflow skips the prompt, logs the auto-decision to `.planning/AUTO-DECISIONS.md`, and continues to commit. When config is `false`, falls through to the original interactive Approve/Adjust/Review prompt.
- **`workflows/new-ddd.md` SPEC.md approval gate**: same shape applied to the DDD spec approval. Default auto-approves; config opt-out restores interactive Approve/Revise/Edit-manually prompt.

### What's classified as non-critical (and why)

Non-critical = the artifact lives on disk after the decision, no destructive action is taken at the gate, and the user can intervene after the fact by editing the artifact or re-invoking the workflow.

- ROADMAP draft: meets all three criteria. Lives at `.planning/ROADMAP.md`; commit is non-destructive; user can edit and re-run `/gsd:plan-phase 1`.
- SPEC.md draft: meets all three. Lives at `docs/SPEC.md`; commit is non-destructive; user can edit before phase execution begins.

### What's still critical (and stays prompting)

- **Verification gaps** (`/gsd:verify-work`): the human-judgment cases where the user's input genuinely matters. Auto-anything here risks accepting bad output.
- **Architectural deviations** (executor agent Rule 4): structural changes requiring user decision. The executor's existing classification (Rules 1-3 auto-fix, Rule 4 always prompt) already handles this layer correctly; no changes needed.
- **Package install failures** (executor Rule 3 exclusion): possible slopsquatted or hallucinated package names. Always require human verification before installing a substitute.
- **`--auto` is not the same as this config**: `--auto` enables a fully automatic flow assuming an idea document is provided. The new config skips only the artifact-approval prompts, not other interactive gates.

### Held for a future release
- **Executor deviation classification with logging**: the executor agent's Rules 1-3 already auto-proceed (no user permission needed), but the auto-decisions go to SUMMARY.md rather than the new central AUTO-DECISIONS.md log. Cross-referencing both logs would give a single pane of glass; held for v2.44.x or v2.45.x.
- **REQUIREMENTS.md approval gate**: `/gsd:new-project` does not have a single explicit "approve REQUIREMENTS.md" prompt; the requirements get built up through several smaller AskUserQuestion prompts. Refactoring to a single approval gate (and applying the auto-approve treatment) is a larger change deferred until the value is clear from real-project use.
- **Other workflows with approval-shaped prompts**: `/gsd:new-milestone` ROADMAP approval, `/gsd:plan-milestone-gaps` plan approval, etc. Same pattern applies; will fold in when users report friction or in a sweep release.

### Upstream
- Plugin-native concept (the `.planning/AUTO-DECISIONS.md` log + `workflow.auto_approve_non_critical` config). Will file as an upstream enhancement proposing the model and per-workflow integration once the pattern has stabilized in real-project use.

## [2.44.3] - 2026-05-24  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Three changes from real-project use of `/gsd:new-ddd`: fixes a synthesizer bug that affects standard `/gsd:new-project` too, moves the DDD spec file to a user-facing path, and adds explicit role separation between PROJECT.md and SPEC.md so GSD-internal language does not leak into the user-facing spec.

### Fixed
- **`agents/gsd-research-synthesizer.md` Step 6 (Write SUMMARY.md)**: agent prompt strengthened with hard rules to prevent the "wrong assumption about restrictions" failure mode observed in real runs. The previous prompt said "ALWAYS use the Write tool" but the LLM sometimes hallucinated a restriction and returned SUMMARY.md content in the response instead of writing the file, leaving the orchestrator to write it manually. New prompt enumerates five hard rules: use the Write tool (it's in the frontmatter allowlist, no restrictions), do not return content in the response, do not ask permission to write, do not use heredoc, surface Write errors instead of silent fallback. Affects both `/gsd:new-project` and `/gsd:new-ddd`.

### Changed (DDD mode)
- **SPEC file path moved from `.planning/DOCS.md` to `docs/SPEC.md`** across `workflows/new-ddd.md`, `agents/gsd-roadmapper.md` `<ddd_mode>` block, `workflows/help.md`, `workflows/do.md`, `skills/new-ddd/SKILL.md`, and README features-table description. Reason: the file is user-facing documentation that ships with the project; `.planning/` is the GSD-internal directory and is conventionally hidden / sometimes gitignored. `docs/SPEC.md` puts the file at a discoverable, user-facing location that survives gitignore patterns and reads as project documentation rather than GSD planning state. Filename "SPEC.md" replaces "DOCS.md" everywhere since "spec" more accurately describes the file's role (canonical specification, not just documentation).
- **New "Role separation between PROJECT.md and `docs/SPEC.md`" subsection** in `workflows/new-ddd.md` Step 6. Explicit guidance table for the orchestrator drafting both files: PROJECT.md is GSD-internal (can talk about phases, plans, roadmap, agent constraints, REQ-IDs, internal decisions); SPEC.md is user-facing (must NOT mention GSD internals; reads as the project's own documentation). Two heuristics for the orchestrator to self-check. Closes a real failure mode observed in early DDD runs where SPEC.md drafts referenced phase numbers and planning artifacts.

### Strategic
- **DDD work stays in gsd-plugin main branch.** A temporary branch-isolation rule (created earlier on 2026-05-24 while the user considered making DDD a standalone sibling project) was rescinded same-day. The user may split DDD into its own project later "when it works decently, which is not yet the case." Until then, DDD evolves in master like any other plugin feature. The `ddd-spike` branch at https://github.com/jnuyens/gsd-plugin/tree/ddd-spike is retired (no longer the destination for new DDD work) but kept on the remote as historical marker.

### Upstream
- Synthesizer fix exists upstream in `open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux` at `get-shit-done/agents/gsd-research-synthesizer.md` with the identical bug-shape (same agent, same Step 6 prompt). Will file as fix-track bug issue with the proposed diff.
- DDD path / role-separation changes extend the existing enhancement issue #212; will be added as a follow-up comment with the new diffs.

## [2.44.2] - 2026-05-24  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Adds `/gsd:new-ddd` to `/gsd:do` smart-router routing. Freeform text describing DDD-shape projects (CLI, library, SDK, API, plugin system) or explicit DDD-mode triggers ("DDD", "docs-driven", "docs-first", "API-first", "README-driven", "write the docs first") now route to `/gsd:new-ddd` instead of `/gsd:new-project`. Generic "start a new project" intent without DDD-shape signals stays on `/gsd:new-project`.

### Changed
- **`workflows/do.md`** routing table: two new rules added BEFORE the existing `/gsd:new-project` rule (since the table uses first-match precedence). The first rule catches explicit DDD-mode triggers. The second rule catches DDD-shape project descriptions that don't explicitly invoke a specific mode and routes to `/gsd:new-ddd` with the option to disambiguate via the new ambiguity-handling section.
- **`workflows/do.md`** project-required exception list updated to include `/gsd:new-ddd` alongside `/gsd:new-project` (neither requires an existing `.planning/` directory).
- **`workflows/do.md`** new "Common ambiguity: `/gsd:new-project` vs. `/gsd:new-ddd`" section documents the prompt template for the dispatcher to ask when shape-ambiguous inputs land. Default fallback is `/gsd:new-project` (older, more general mode) when the user does not pick.

### Upstream
- DDD mode is plugin-native (see #212 enhancement proposal); the `/gsd:do` routing extension follows naturally. No upstream change needed until DDD itself lands upstream.

## [2.44.1] - 2026-05-24  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Docs catch-up for v2.44.0. The `Added features beyond upstream` table in README.md did not list the new Documentation-Driven Development mode shipped in v2.44.0; this release adds the entry. Patch-level bump so existing users get prompted to update via `/plugin marketplace update` and see the corrected feature listing without a fresh install.

### Changed
- **`README.md` `## Added features beyond upstream` table**: new top row documenting `/gsd:new-ddd`. Cross-references the v2.44.0 release for the full description and the held-back items.

## [2.44.0] - 2026-05-24  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

**New mode: Documentation-Driven Development (DDD).** Adds `/gsd:new-ddd` as a sibling to `/gsd:new-project`. DDD mode is for projects where the user-facing surface is the deliverable (CLIs, libraries, SDKs, APIs, plugin systems): the user validates a `DOCS.md` (user-facing documentation as the spec) before any phase work begins, and phases are derived from DOCS.md sections rather than from REQ-ID clusters.

This is a minimal sketch (intentionally not the full implementation). Per-phase docs-sync automation, docs-aware verification, and DOCS.md drift detection in /gsd:next are held for v2.45.x and later, pending real-project usage to inform the design. The minimal sketch encodes DDD in the project-initialization sequence and the roadmapper's source-of-truth choice, which is enough to use the mode end-to-end with manual doc updates during execution.

### Added
- **`skills/new-ddd/SKILL.md`**: new top-level skill `/gsd:new-ddd`. Thin entry point that delegates to `workflows/new-ddd.md`. Inherits the `--auto` flag from `/gsd:new-project`. Includes guidance on when to use DDD vs. standard new-project.
- **`workflows/new-ddd.md`**: full DDD initialization workflow. Reuses shared steps from `workflows/new-project.md` (setup, questioning, brownfield mapping, config capture, research) and overrides the requirements-gathering step with DOCS.md drafting + user validation. Generates a thin `REQUIREMENTS.md` (one `DOC-NN` per DOCS.md H2 section) for traceability compatibility with existing downstream workflows.
- **`agents/gsd-roadmapper.md` `<ddd_mode>` block**: documents the inputs the roadmapper reads in DDD mode, the phase-derivation heuristic (cluster DOCS.md H2 sections), the success-criteria shape (anchored at DOCS.md sections), and the coverage-validation model (every H2 maps to exactly one phase). Adds a per-phase `**DDD spec anchor**:` line to ROADMAP.md output.

### Changed
- **`agents/gsd-roadmapper.md` spawned-by list**: now includes `/gsd:new-ddd`, `/gsd:new-milestone`, and `/gsd:plan-milestone-gaps` (the latter two were always callers but were not documented in the agent header).
- **`workflows/help.md`**: documents `/gsd:new-ddd` in the Discovery & Specification section.

### Held for future releases (v2.45.x and beyond)
- Per-phase `/gsd:docs-sync` workflow that detects implementation-vs-DOCS.md drift during execution and updates DOCS.md sections.
- Docs-aware verification (a `gsd-docs-checker` agent or extension of `gsd-verifier`) that confirms implementation matches the corresponding DOCS.md section.
- DOCS.md drift detection in `/gsd:next` that warns when DOCS.md was edited since last verification.
- Auto-decomposition of DOCS.md into fine-grained REQ-IDs (currently one per H2 section; richer mapping would track per-command / per-endpoint / per-extension-point items).
- Dedicated `gsd-ddd-docs-writer` subagent if inline orchestrator drafting becomes context-pressure problematic on large projects.

### Upstream
- DDD mode is plugin-native; the redux upstream does not have this concept. Will file as an enhancement issue proposing the model and the minimal-sketch shape, with the option to upstream the full implementation later if it proves valuable in real-project use. Same Gate 0 workaround applies (external fork-PRs blocked; diff ships via issue comment).

### Why a minor version bump (2.43.12 -> 2.44.0)
DDD mode adds a meaningful new top-level command and a new mental model for project initialization. Patch-level bumps have been reserved for fixes and small workflow tweaks; introducing a new mode warrants a minor bump to signal the surface change.

## [2.43.12] - 2026-05-23  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Tightens roadmap granularity defaults in `gsd-roadmapper` to reduce thin-phase / over-fragmentation. The user-side observation that drove this change: roadmaps tended to come back with ~15-20% too many phases, often manifesting as "GSD maintenance" phases (single-requirement, internal-quality goal like "improve performance" or "add tests for X", success criteria that read as tasks not user-observable outcomes) that would have been better folded into the most-related neighbor.

The prior Standard 5-8 default was the main driver: it gave the LLM permission to overshoot by padding for "completeness" even when the work didn't justify a separate phase. Tightening Standard to 4-6 forces consolidation as the baseline; the explicit Fine 6-10 bucket remains available for projects that genuinely need it.

### Changed
- **`agents/gsd-roadmapper.md` Granularity Calibration table**: Coarse moves from 3-5 to 2-4, Standard from 5-8 to 4-6, Fine from 8-12 to 6-10. Added an inline guidance paragraph below the table naming the thin-phase failure pattern (single requirement, internal-quality goal phrasing, task-shaped success criteria) and instructing the agent to prefer folding into a neighbor over creating a standalone phase in those cases.

### Affected entry points
- `/gsd:new-project` (initial roadmap generation)
- `/gsd:new-milestone` (next-milestone roadmap)
- `/gsd:plan-milestone-gaps` (post-audit fix phases)

All three spawn `gsd-roadmapper`, so the granularity shift applies uniformly.

### Why default-shift not consolidation-pass
A consolidation pass (re-reading the draft and self-merging thin phases) is a stronger intervention but adds prompt complexity and re-read cost. The granularity tweak is a lighter-touch baseline change; if the pattern persists, a consolidation pass remains the natural next iteration. Tracked as a follow-up if v2.43.12's behavior change is insufficient.

### Upstream
- Same `gsd-roadmapper` agent exists upstream in `open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux` at `get-shit-done/agents/gsd-roadmapper.md` with identical granularity table. Will file as enhancement issue (this is a behavior tuning, not a bug); same Gate 0 workaround applies (fork-PRs blocked; diff ships via issue comment).

## [2.43.11] - 2026-05-23  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Extends the v2.43.10 Route 0 resume-incomplete-phase invariant from `/gsd:next` to `/gsd:progress` (default mode). The two commands are sibling entry points; `/gsd:next` was patched in v2.43.10, but the default `/gsd:progress` report-and-route flow doesn't go through next.md and so still inherited the same bug-shape: routing based on `current_phase` from STATE.md without first verifying that all earlier phases have complete execution.

Audit performed against all workflows that route on phase state. Surfaced one additional vulnerable workflow (progress.md). Confirmed five other workflows are NOT vulnerable because they already scan all phases via `gsd-sdk query roadmap.analyze` or explicit `find PLAN without SUMMARY` loops: `autonomous.md` iterate (uses disk_status filter), `complete-milestone.md` (disk_status check), `resume-project.md` (explicit incomplete-plan loop), `discuss-phase-assumptions.md` auto_advance (within-phase only), `execute-phase.md` (requires explicit phase argument).

### Fixed
- **`workflows/progress.md` `route` step**: new "Step 0: Resume-incomplete-phase invariant" added before the existing Step 1. Scans all phases via the `$ROADMAP` JSON already loaded in `analyze_roadmap`, finds the lowest-numbered phase where `plans.length > summaries.length`, routes to `/gsd:execute-phase <that phase>` if found. The progress report from the `report` step still displays first, so the user sees full project status before the routing decision. Skip with `--no-resume` (falls through to existing current-phase counting) or `--force` (bypasses all gates).

### Changed
- **`workflows/help.md` `/gsd:progress` description**: documents the new mid-execution session safety behavior, including the `--no-resume` opt-out.

### Upstream
- Same Route 0 fix applies. Will extend issue #160 (the existing /gsd:next fix issue) with the progress.md diff. Both files have the same bug-shape and the fix shape is identical, so bundling reduces maintainer review surface.

## [2.43.10] - 2026-05-23  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Fix for a session-resume bug in `/gsd:next` (and `/gsd:progress --next`). When a session died mid-execution (hang, token exhaustion, API connection disruption) and STATE.md's `current_phase` got advanced past the phase that still had unfinished work, `/gsd:next` would route to a forward action and silently skip the partially-executed phase's incomplete plans. The prior-phase scan in `safety_gates` detected the situation but offered Stop/Defer/Force without a "Resume" option, so the default user response either stopped the workflow (Stop) or filed the unfinished plans to a `999.x` backlog and advanced anyway (Defer).

The fix is a new Route 0 invariant: before any other routing decision, scan all phases for incomplete execution and route to `/gsd:execute-phase <lowest-numbered incomplete phase>` if found. Complete-before-advance is now a hard invariant of the routing layer.

### Fixed
- **`workflows/next.md`**: new `resume_incomplete_phase` step between `safety_gates` and `spike_sketch_notice`. Scans all phases in ROADMAP order via `gsd-sdk query roadmap.analyze` + `gsd-sdk query find-phase <N>`; the first phase with `plans.length > summaries.length` is the resume target. Routes silently to `/gsd:execute-phase <N>` with a one-line notice naming the phase. Skip the check with `--no-resume` (falls through to the existing prior-phase prompt for explicit defer) or `--force` (skips all gates including this one).

### Changed
- **`workflows/help.md` `/gsd:progress --next` description**: documents the new auto-resume behavior, the `--no-resume` opt-out, and the existing `--force` bypass.

### Upstream
- Same routing logic exists upstream in `open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux` at `get-shit-done/workflows/next.md`. Will file as a fix-track bug issue (this is a real correctness bug, not just a UX preference: data loss surface via the silent-defer path) and post the proposed diff. Same Gate 0 workaround applies (fork-PRs blocked; diff ships via issue comment).

## [2.43.9] - 2026-05-23  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Extension of the v2.43.8 auto-use-existing pattern to four additional artifact-existence prompts. Same logic applies: when an artifact already exists and the workflow's natural next step is "use it," prompting for confirmation is friction. The explicit-flag escape hatches (`--refresh` to regenerate, `--view` to print, `--update` for partial refresh on map-codebase) cover every deviation path. Default behavior is now auto-proceed with a one-line notice.

### Changed
- **`workflows/ui-phase.md` step 4 (UI-SPEC.md existing-artifact handling)**: when `UI-SPEC.md` exists and neither `--refresh` nor `--view` is set, auto-proceeds to step 7 (checker) on the existing spec instead of prompting Update/View/Skip. Replaces the AskUserQuestion with a one-line notice. `--refresh` re-spawns the researcher (was "Update" in the prompt); `--view` prints to stdout and exits. The previous "Skip" path matches the new default behavior.
- **`workflows/ai-integration-phase.md` step 4 (AI-SPEC.md existing-artifact handling)**: same pattern. Auto-exit with notice when `AI-SPEC.md` exists; `--refresh` re-runs framework-selector and the downstream pipeline; `--view` prints to stdout. Replaces the three-way Update/View/Skip prompt.
- **`workflows/ui-review.md` step 1 (UI-REVIEW.md existing-artifact handling)**: auto-exit with notice when `UI-REVIEW.md` exists; `--refresh` runs a fresh audit; `--view` prints to stdout. Replaces the two-way Re-audit/View prompt.
- **`workflows/eval-review.md` step 1 (EVAL-REVIEW.md existing-artifact handling)**: same as ui-review pattern.
- **`workflows/map-codebase.md` `check_existing` step (codebase/ existing-artifact handling)**: auto-exit with notice when `.planning/codebase/` exists; `--refresh` deletes and remaps; `--update [<docs>]` partial-refreshes (with or without a comma-separated doc list). Replaces the three-way Refresh/Update/Skip prompt.
- **`workflows/help.md`**: command signatures and per-command descriptions updated to document the new `--refresh`, `--view`, and `--update` flags.

### Upstream
- All five prompts exist upstream in `open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux`. Will extend the enhancement issue #159 (filed for the analogous RESEARCH.md fix in v2.43.8) with the four additional prompts, or file a sibling issue if maintainer prefers narrower scope per issue. Same Gate 0 workaround pattern applies (fork-PRs blocked; diff posted as issue comment).

## [2.43.8] - 2026-05-23  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

UX refinement in research-only mode. `/gsd:plan-phase --research-phase N` used to prompt with a three-way Update/View/Skip menu when `RESEARCH.md` already existed for the target phase. The friction outweighed the value in practice: callers reaching for `--research-phase` either want to refresh research (covered by `--research`) or print it (covered by `--view`); the third option ("Skip") was the prompt's reason for existing, but it duplicated what auto-proceed-with-existing would do anyway. The standard `/gsd:plan-phase N` flow at §5.1 already auto-uses existing research without prompting; research-only mode now matches that behavior.

### Changed
- **`workflows/plan-phase.md` §5.0 (research-only existing-artifact handling)**: when `RESEARCH.md` already exists and neither `--research` nor `--view` is set, emit a one-line notice naming the file and exit cleanly. No more Update/View/Skip prompt. The explicit-flag escape hatches (`--research` for force-refresh, `--view` for print) still work and are now the only paths that deviate from "use existing." Help text in `workflows/help.md` updated to match.

### Upstream
- Same prompt exists upstream in `open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux` at `get-shit-done/workflows/plan-phase.md` §5.0. Filed enhancement issue and proposed the diff via issue comment (fork-PRs blocked on the redux per [[reference_upstream_gsd_contribution.md]] Gate 0).

## [2.43.7] - 2026-05-23  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Workflow robustness fix and branding polish. Two workflows had `config-get workflow.nyquist_validation` calls that didn't supply a `--default` value: `workflows/validate-phase.md` was fully unguarded (would emit `Error: Key not found` to stderr and leave the variable empty when the key is unset), and `workflows/audit-milestone.md` redirected stderr but had no fallback (silent empty variable). The downstream "is the variable equal to false" checks behaved correctly by accident (empty != "false" treats absent-key as enabled, matching the documented default), but the stderr noise was real and the empty-variable trail through audit-milestone.md is the kind of silent-failure mode that breaks once a future patch adds a meaningful `--raw` consumer.

### Fixed
- **`workflows/validate-phase.md:28`**: `NYQUIST_CFG=$(gsd-sdk query config-get workflow.nyquist_validation --raw --default true)` (was missing `--default`, also missing `2>/dev/null` and `|| echo`). Now uses `--default true` to match the documented default-when-absent semantic and silence the stderr noise.
- **`workflows/audit-milestone.md:146`**: Same fix. `--raw --default true` replaces `--raw 2>/dev/null`. Removes the silent-empty trap.

### Changed
- **README header**: dropped redundant "GSD Plugin --" prefix from H1 (the new branding logo above the H1 already conveys "GSD plugin"). Title is now "Get Shit Done for Claude Code".

### Upstream
- Same bugs exist in `open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux` at `get-shit-done/workflows/validate-phase.md` and `get-shit-done/workflows/audit-milestone.md`. Filed bug issue and patch PR following the redux contribution-rules ceremony (typed bug_report.yml form, fix.md PR template, `Fixes #NNN` link). PR pending maintainer triage for `confirmed-bug` label.

## [2.43.6] - 2026-05-22  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3, hosted at open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux)

Upstream pointer change. The original `gsd-build/get-shit-done` repo was locked on 2026-05-22 after the founder rug-pulled the associated `$GSD` Solana token and deleted his social accounts (see [intellectia.ai](https://intellectia.ai/news/crypto/gsd-token-allegedly-rugpulled-after-founder-exit) and [ourcryptotalk](https://ourcryptotalk.com/news/bags-hackathon-winner-gsd-cloud-rug-pull) for independent coverage). Within hours, GSD collaborator [trek-e](https://github.com/trek-e) (Tom Boucher) launched a bit-perfect community continuation at [open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux](https://github.com/open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux): same MIT-licensed code, all 394 branches and 229 tags mirrored, all 77 open issues and 17 open PRs imported with cross-references. The plugin treats `open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux` as upstream from this release forward.

No source code changed at the cutover. The redux is bit-perfect with the pre-rug tree; only URLs and npm package names move. The plugin still ships the same base-tree as v2.43.5 (upstream GSD 1.42.3) and the same `#PLUGIN-DEPS-ON-CASE-INSENSITIVE` patch. trek-e independently landed a more thorough version of that patch in redux as PR [#88](https://github.com/open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux/pull/88) (with collision-detection guard, canonical-casing assertions, and atomic SDK+CJS update); the plugin patch will retire naturally on the first redux-based sync.

### Changed
- **`README.md`**, top-of-file. Updated "Based on" line to point at the redux release tag, added a new "Upstream change (May 2026)" call-out documenting the rug-pull and migration with links to the two press articles and the redux's [migration announcement](https://github.com/open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux/discussions/109). Drift-resilience and "For users of upstream GSD" sections rewritten to reference the redux. Credits section updated to mention both the original (TACHES) and the new maintainer (trek-e + contributors).
- **`workflows/forensics.md`, `workflows/update.md`, `workflows/help.md`, `workflows/new-project.md`, `workflows/new-milestone.md`, `workflows/quick.md`**. User-facing references to `gsd-build/get-shit-done` and the `get-shit-done-cc` npm package retargeted to `open-gsd/get-shit-done-redux` and `get-shit-done-redux`. `/gsd:forensics` issue-filing path now targets the redux for bug reports. `/gsd:update` recipe references the new npm package.
- **Pre-install uninstall guidance.** Now lists both pre-rug (`get-shit-done-cc`, `@gsd-build/sdk`) and post-rug (`get-shit-done-redux`, `@gsd-redux/sdk`) global packages so users with either install can clear conflicts.

### Added
- **Short-form case-insensitive test** (`sdk/src/query/phase.test.ts`, 30 cases up from 29 in v2.43.5): a `05D` phase with `05D-02` declaring `depends_on: [01]` (bare short-form) referencing the uppercase-suffix plan `05D-01`. Exercises the `shortFormToId` lookup tier that the original v2.43.5 test (canonical-prefix form `05c-01`) did not cover. trek-e's upstream review on PR #3786 flagged this gap; the plugin now covers both.
- **`bin/lib/phase.cjs`** comment block explicitly documenting that the CJS path supports a subset of the SDK's lookup forms (full plan ID + canonical prefix only, no short-form). Closes a parity question raised in trek-e's upstream review.

### Deferred to first redux-based sync
- **`bin/maintenance/check-upstream-schema.cjs`** still references `gsd-build/get-shit-done` for the upstream tarball download. The redux's release tarball naming (`get-shit-done-redux-<version>/`) differs from gsd-build's (`get-shit-done-<version>/`). Since gsd-build's frozen v1.42.3 tarball is still downloadable and the plugin remains on v1.42.3, this script keeps working without changes until the first redux-based sync. Tracked in [[project_upstream_switch_2026_05]] memory.
- **`sdk/package.json` / `sdk/README.md`** still self-identify as `@gsd-build/sdk`. These are bundled build artifacts not exposed via npm to plugin users; they will rename on the first redux-based sync.

## [2.43.5] - 2026-05-21  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3)

Robustness fix in plan-id resolution. The `phase.plan-index` query now resolves `depends_on` references case-insensitively, so a plan with frontmatter `depends_on: [05c-01]` matches a sibling plan whose filename is `05C-01-PLAN.md` (and vice versa). Previously the lookup was strict-case via `Map.has()` on the raw plan ID, which silently dropped the edge, collapsed the dependent into wave 1, and surfaced a misleading "declared wave: N but depends_on DAG places it in wave 1" warning. Real-world repro: plans authored by the `gsd-planner` agent occasionally lowercase letter-suffix phases (e.g. `05c` while files are `05C`), and the dropped edge would only surface once execution ordering produced a downstream failure.

### Fixed
- **`sdk/src/query/phase.ts`** and **`bin/lib/phase.cjs`** (parallel CJS) plan-id lookup maps (`planMap`, `canonicalToId`, `shortFormToId`) now key on the lowercased plan ID, and `dep` is lowercased at lookup time. Resolved deps preserve the canonical-cased plan ID stored as the map value, so output wave assignments and warning messages still use the on-disk casing. The collision surface is negligible: the plan-id namespace is `NN`, `NN-NN`, or `NN-NN-slug` with an optional letter suffix on the phase segment, and a single phase directory cannot host two plans whose IDs differ only in case (POSIX filesystems treat them as distinct files, but the second file would still collide on canonical-prefix indexing).

### Added
- **Test coverage**, new `phase.test.ts` case (30 total, up from 29): a `05C` phase with an uppercase-suffix plan `05C-01-PLAN.md` and a sibling `05C-02-PLAN.md` whose `depends_on: [05c-01]` uses lowercase canonical-prefix form. Asserts wave 1 contains `05C-01`, wave 2 contains `05C-02`, and `warnings` is empty (no unresolved-reference warning, no wave-mismatch warning).

### Plugin patches added
- **`sdk/src/query/phase.ts` + `bin/lib/phase.cjs`** (`#PLUGIN-DEPS-ON-CASE-INSENSITIVE`) tracked in the plugin-patches inventory. Proposed to upstream `gsd-build/get-shit-done` in a separate PR (see commit message for link). If upstream accepts, the markers can be retired during a future sync cycle.

## [2.43.4] - 2026-05-19  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3)

Discoverability fix. Adds a SessionStart hook that nudges users with stale caches to run `/plugin marketplace update`. Triggered by the fourth re-report of the v2.40.2-fixed MCP framing bug from a user on v2.38.x ([#7](https://github.com/jnuyens/gsd-plugin/issues/7)): the bug has been gone for 12 days, but the marketplace does not auto-update by default and four reporters in a row didn't run the update recipe even though the README documents it.

### Added
- **`hooks/gsd-staleness-reminder.js`** (`SessionStart`) reads the plugin's `CHANGELOG.md`, parses the topmost `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` entry, computes the age in days, and if older than the staleness threshold (default 14 days, override via `GSD_STALENESS_DAYS` env var) emits a structured `additionalContext` advisory naming the installed version, age, threshold, and the exact 3-command refresh recipe (`/plugin marketplace update`, `/plugin install gsd@gsd-plugin`, `/reload-plugins`). Silent when the cache is fresh, when `CHANGELOG.md` is unreadable, or when no valid release-date entry is found (defensive failure mode is silence, not noise).
- **Test coverage**, four new sub-cases in `tests/hooks-smoke.test.cjs` (20 total, up from 16): silent when fresh, warns when 30 days stale, silent when CHANGELOG missing, honors `GSD_STALENESS_DAYS=7` override at 10 days.

### Background
- Issues [#1](https://github.com/jnuyens/gsd-plugin/issues/1), [#2](https://github.com/jnuyens/gsd-plugin/issues/2), [#3](https://github.com/jnuyens/gsd-plugin/issues/3), and [#7](https://github.com/jnuyens/gsd-plugin/issues/7) all reported the same MCP framing bug. All four reporters were on v2.38.x; the fix has been on master since v2.40.2 (2026-05-07). The v2.38.x README's "Updating" section already documents the correct recipe, so docs are not the gap; the gap is friction between "user starts a session" and "user thinks to update". A SessionStart advisory closes that gap without requiring user opt-in.
- This is the third user-protection hook in the SessionStart chain after v2.43.1's `gsd-shadowing-sdk-detector.js` (shadowing global SDK in PATH) and the long-standing `gsd-session-state.sh` (project state reminder). The chain is now 4 entries: dispatcher, session-state, shadowing-detector, staleness-reminder.

### Recommended user response
When the advisory fires, run the 3-command refresh recipe. The advisory will then disappear until the next 14-day window. If a user wants the threshold tighter or looser, they can set `GSD_STALENESS_DAYS` in their environment.

## [2.43.3] - 2026-05-17  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.3)

Upstream hotfix sync from v1.42.2 to v1.42.3 (35 commits, primarily phase-removal logic hardening and a `plan-phase` closed-phase guard). All 4 in-tree plugin patches and the 3 SDK source patch markers survive automatically this cycle because upstream did not touch the patched files; only `bin/lib/core.cjs` required surgical re-apply of the `#PLUGIN-AGENTS-DIR` blocks. The bundled SDK was rebuilt because 8 other `sdk/src/` modules changed.

### Changed
- **Version bump**, plugin `2.43.2` to `2.43.3`.
- Refreshed wholesale from upstream: `agents/` (5 files), `bin/lib/` (8 files), `sdk/src/` (8 files including 1 new test), `workflows/` (4 files).
- Rebundled `sdk/dist/cli.js` via `tsc + esbuild`; bundle is 1.66 MB and carries 3 `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` matches.

### Fixed (selected upstream highlights)
- **Phase removal logic hardening** (v1.42.3, [#3599](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3599), [#3600](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3600), [#3601](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3601), [#3602](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3602)) prefixed-phase headings now treated as section boundaries, peer-depth decimal phase preservation on integer phase removal, slugged plan-ref renumbering on phase removal, and project-code-prefixed phase dir counting in the milestone filter.
- **`plan-phase` gated on closed phases** (v1.42.3, [#3569](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3569)) `init.plan-phase` surfaces `phase_status`; `/gsd:plan-phase` errors out on closed phases instead of silently re-planning.
- **W007 warning ignores archived phases** (v1.42.3, [#3560](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3560)) repos using a milestone-archive layout no longer get false-positive "Phase N in ROADMAP but no directory" warnings for archived phases.
- **Codex install hardening** (v1.42.3, [#3610](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3610)) fresh Codex installs no longer block when leftover bundled hooks are present in the project tree.
- **Installer migration env override** (v1.42.3) `GSD_INSTALLER_MIGRATION_DIR` honored when resolving the migrations directory.

### Added
- **Antigravity first-class runtime** (v1.42.3, [#3608](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3608)) `update.md` models Antigravity (Google's IDE) as a first-class runtime alongside Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and the existing runtime list.

### Plugin patches preserved verbatim
- **`bin/lib/core.cjs`** (`#PLUGIN-AGENTS-DIR`) upstream modified `core.cjs` this cycle; the 2x `[PLUGIN PATCH]` blocks (`resolveGsdRoot` / `resolveGsdDataDir` / `resolveGsdAsset` helper exports plus the patched `getAgentsDir` body) were re-applied surgically after the wholesale copy.
- **`bin/lib/model-catalog.cjs`** (`#PLUGIN-MODEL-CATALOG-PATH`) upstream did NOT modify this file v1.42.2..v1.42.3; the flat-layout candidate-prepend patch survives automatically.
- **`bin/gsd-tools.cjs`** upstream did NOT modify this file v1.42.2..v1.42.3; 4 dispatch cases (`write-phase-memory`, `checkpoint`, `hook`, `migrate`) survive automatically.
- **`hooks/gsd-context-monitor.js`** (`#PLUGIN-HOOK-CONTEXT-MONITOR`) upstream `hooks/` entirely unchanged v1.42.2..v1.42.3; patch survives automatically.
- **`sdk/src/query/state-project-load.ts` + `sdk/src/query-gsd-tools-path.ts` + `sdk/src/sdk-package-compatibility.ts::legacyAssetProbes`** (SDK source patches) none of the 3 patched files appear in the upstream sdk/src/ diff this cycle; patches survive automatically. Bundle still carries 3 `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` matches.

### Plugin-owned (untouched by sync)
- `bin/gsd-sdk` + `bin/gsd-sdk.cmd` (`#PLUGIN-WRAPPER-ENV-EXPORT`) byte-identical (sha256 verified pre/post sync).
- `hooks/gsd-shadowing-sdk-detector.js` (added in v2.43.1) byte-identical (sha256 verified pre/post sync).
- `commands/` remains absent (per plugin policy).

### Tests
- Regression trifecta passes against the synced tree: `tests/mcp-stdio-framing.test.cjs` (8 tools), `tests/workspace-json-integration.test.cjs` (22 checks), `tests/hooks-smoke.test.cjs` (16/16 including the v2.43.1 shadowing-sdk-detector cases).

See full upstream release notes: <https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/releases/tag/v1.42.3>

## [2.43.2] - 2026-05-17  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.2)

Docs hotfix on v2.43.1. Replaces the misleading README claim that a pre-v2.42.0 global `gsd-sdk` install "keeps working" with explicit pre-install uninstall instructions. The shadowing global at `/opt/homebrew/bin/gsd-sdk` (or `/usr/local/bin/gsd-sdk`) does NOT honor `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` and causes `agents_installed: false` in `/gsd:new-project` and similar workflows, so users with a legacy install must remove it before the plugin can resolve its bundled agents. v2.43.1's runtime SessionStart detector now has a matching README entry to send users to.

### Changed
- **README** Replaced "No prerequisites" wording that downplayed pre-v2.42.0 shadowing globals as "no breakage". Added a new "Pre-install: remove any pre-v2.42.0 global SDK install" subsection with the `which gsd-sdk` diagnostic, the two `npm uninstall -g` commands (`@gsd-build/sdk` and `get-shit-done-cc`), expected post-uninstall outputs, and a forward reference to the v2.43.1 SessionStart detector for users who skip the step.

## [2.43.1] - 2026-05-15  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.2)

Hotfix on v2.43.0. Adds a SessionStart hook that detects a shadowing `gsd-sdk` binary on `$PATH` (typically a leftover `npm install -g get-shit-done-cc` or `@gsd-build/sdk` from the pre-v2.42.0 prerequisite era) and emits a one-time advisory recommending the user uninstall it. The shadowing global takes PATH precedence over the plugin's bundled wrapper, does not honor `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, and causes spurious `agents_installed: false` reports in `/gsd:new-project` and similar workflows.

### Added
- **`hooks/gsd-shadowing-sdk-detector.js`** (`SessionStart`) cross-platform PATH walker. Resolves symlinks before comparing against the plugin's bundled wrapper at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/gsd-sdk`. Silent when no shadowing is detected. Emits a structured `additionalContext` payload pointing at the offending binary and giving the exact `npm uninstall` recipe.
- **Test coverage**, three new sub-cases in `tests/hooks-smoke.test.cjs` (16 total, previously 13): silent when only the plugin wrapper is in PATH, silent when no `gsd-sdk` is in PATH, warns when a non-plugin `gsd-sdk` is first in PATH. Validates JSON envelope shape and the presence of the `npm uninstall` guidance.

### Background
- The plugin v2.42.0 bundled `sdk/dist/cli.js` so the standalone `get-shit-done-cc` / `@gsd-build/sdk` npm package became unnecessary. Pre-v2.42.0 users who installed it via `npm -g` are still affected on every session.
- The v2.42.5 `#PLUGIN-WRAPPER-ENV-EXPORT` patch exports `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` and `GSD_AGENTS_DIR` from the plugin's wrapper, but only fires when the wrapper itself is invoked. With a shadowing global in `$PATH`, the wrapper is bypassed and the patch is silent. v2.43.1 closes the loop with first-line user-visible diagnosis.

### Recommended user action
If the SessionStart advisory fires, run `npm uninstall -g @gsd-build/sdk` (and `npm uninstall -g get-shit-done-cc` if also installed). `which gsd-sdk` should then resolve to a path under `.claude/plugins/cache/gsd-plugin/`.

## [2.43.0] - 2026-05-15  (based on upstream GSD 1.42.2)

Upstream patch sync, picks up GSD 1.42.0 + 1.42.1 + 1.42.2 (published 2026-05-15). The plugin skipped intermediate v1.42.0 (RC pattern) and v1.42.1 via the daily-sync cadence change; this single bump consolidates all three patch releases plus the post-merge work that landed at v1.42.2. SDK source patch surface evolved (upstream consolidated CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT probes into `sdk-package-compatibility.ts::legacyAssetProbes`), surgically re-applied. Bundled SDK rebundled, 1.66 MB, contains 3 CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT matches (one per patched module + the consolidated probe).

### Changed
- **Version bump**, plugin `2.42.6 to 2.43.0`.
- **`agents/`** refreshed wholesale (28 of 33 files updated, 5 new from upstream).
- **`bin/lib/*`** refreshed wholesale (61 upstream `.cjs` files plus a new `installer-migrations/` subdir with 3 baseline scripts).
- **`bin/gsd-tools.cjs`** refreshed; 4 plugin dispatch cases (`write-phase-memory`, `checkpoint`, `hook`, `migrate`) re-inserted before the `default:` block.
- **`hooks/gsd-context-monitor.js` + `hooks/gsd-workflow-guard.js`** refreshed.
- **`sdk/src/*`** refreshed wholesale (~70 TypeScript modules including new `sdk-package-compatibility.ts` seam).
- **`workflows/` + `templates/` + `references/`** refreshed from upstream `get-shit-done/{workflows,templates,references}/`.
- **`sdk/dist/cli.js`** rebundled via `npm run build` (`tsc + esbuild`); 1.66 MB single-file ESM bundle with `createRequire` shim.

### Added (selected upstream highlights)
- **STATE.md Document Module via generator** (v1.42.2, [#3531](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3531)) Phase 1 of #3524, the CJS to SDK hard-seam ADR. Generated STATE.md surface enforces consistent shape across runtimes.
- **`init.phase-op` / `init.plan-phase` expose `expected_phase_dir`** (v1.42.1, [#3287](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3287)) projects with `project_code` set no longer accumulate two-headed naming conventions (`01-foundation/` mixed with `XR-02.1-spike/`).
- **Statusline `context_position` config** (v1.42.x, [#2937](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/2937)) opt-in narrow-terminal layout for context utilization indicator.
- **`gsd-sdk query commit --respect-staged`** (v1.42.x, [#3522](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3522)) opt-in flag so SDK-driven commits no longer silently overwrite staged files.

### Fixed (selected upstream highlights)
- **ROADMAP regex consolidation** (v1.42.2, [#3538](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3538)) every phase-number ROADMAP regex now routes through `phaseMarkdownRegexSource`; fixes spurious "phase in ROADMAP but no directory" warnings on milestone-archive layouts.
- **`buildStateFrontmatter` counts nested plans** (v1.42.1, [#3261](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3261)) repos using the nested `plans/<N>-PLAN-<NN>-<slug>.md` layout no longer get `progress.*` counters silently overwritten downward on every state mutation.
- **Self-healing migration of legacy top-level `branching_strategy`** (v1.42.x, [#3523](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3523)) CJS `loadConfig` no longer emits false-positive warnings for legacy config schemas.
- **`phase.complete` refreshes all STATE.md fields** (v1.42.x, [#3517](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3517)) phase completion now derives `completed_phases` from ROADMAP and rewrites the full body+frontmatter, fixing STATE drift after `phase complete`.
- **`reapply-patches` `gsd-update` filter arm** (v1.42.x, [#3516](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3516)) missing arm in two-way merge filter was silently skipping update-flow patches.
- **`quick.md` cleanup-loop CWD safety** (v1.42.x, [#3521](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3521)) bare `git` commands in the quick-task cleanup loop now pin CWD to project root before executing.

### Plugin patches preserved verbatim
- **`bin/lib/core.cjs`** (`#PLUGIN-AGENTS-DIR`) `resolveGsdRoot` / `resolveGsdDataDir` / `resolveGsdAsset` helper exports + the `getAgentsDir()` plugin-flat preference. Upstream `core.cjs` diff was substantial (~500 lines); patch surgically re-inserted at lines 21 and 1284 (HEAD), `[PLUGIN PATCH]` markers intact.
- **`bin/lib/model-catalog.cjs`** (`#PLUGIN-MODEL-CATALOG-PATH`) flat-layout candidate prepended to upstream's 3-candidate resolver list. Upstream resolver shape unchanged this cycle; folded in as candidate #0 same as v2.42.4.
- **`bin/gsd-tools.cjs`** 4 dispatch cases (`write-phase-memory`, `checkpoint`, `hook`, `migrate`). Hook subtypes (`session-start`, `pre-compact`, `post-tool-use`, `stop`) preserved; re-inserted as a block before the `default:` clause.
- **`hooks/gsd-context-monitor.js`** (`#PLUGIN-HOOK-CONTEXT-MONITOR`) drops the `get-shit-done` segment from `__dirname` traversal + honors `GSD_TOOLS_PATH` env override. Re-applied at line 138, marker intact.
- **`sdk/src/query/state-project-load.ts` + `sdk/src/query-gsd-tools-path.ts`** (SDK source patches) upstream v1.42.2 consolidated the CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT probe logic into `sdk-package-compatibility::legacyAssetProbes`. Patch evolved: the functional probe lives in the consolidated helper (prepending a plugin-flat candidate), while `[PLUGIN PATCH]` markers + module-load `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` references stay in both target files so the bundled SDK carries one match per patched module (gate expects >=2; bundle now carries 3).

### Plugin-owned (untouched by sync)
- `bin/gsd-sdk` + `bin/gsd-sdk.cmd` (`#PLUGIN-WRAPPER-ENV-EXPORT`) byte-identical (sha256 verified pre/post sync).
- `bin/maintenance/`, `bin/validate-plugin.cjs`, `hooks/gsd-prompt-guard.js`, `hooks/gsd-read-guard.js`, `hooks/gsd-read-injection-scanner.js`, `hooks/gsd-validate-commit.sh`, `hooks/gsd-phase-boundary.sh`, `hooks/gsd-session-state.sh`, `hooks/lib/` upstream did not change these between v1.41.2 and v1.42.2, so they remain in place.
- `commands/` remains absent (per plugin policy, see memory entry "No bundled commands/").

### Excluded from this pass
- `hooks/gsd-statusline.js`, `hooks/gsd-update-banner.js` upstream-only, plugin does not ship.
- `gsd-check-update.js` deferred indefinitely (decision from v2.42.6 retained).

### Tests
- Regression trifecta passes against the synced tree: `tests/mcp-stdio-framing.test.cjs` (8 tools), `tests/workspace-json-integration.test.cjs` (22 checks), `tests/hooks-smoke.test.cjs` (13/13).

See full upstream release notes: <https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/releases/tag/v1.42.2>

## [2.42.6] - 2026-05-13  (based on upstream GSD 1.41.2)

Pull 8 upstream hook scripts (security and correctness defense-in-depth) into the plugin's `hooks/` tree. First ship is soft-warn: all guards either no-op silently or emit advisory `additionalContext` without blocking the tool call. The conventional-commits validator is the lone exception (blocks on bad commit messages) and is opt-in via `.planning/config.json` `{"hooks":{"community":true}}`. The plugin's existing 5 dispatcher entries (SessionStart auto-resume, PreToolUse Edit|Write, PostToolUse periodic checkpoint, PreCompact, Stop rate-limit nudge) are preserved unchanged: hybrid hook architecture per design.

### Added
- **`hooks/gsd-prompt-guard.js`** (PreToolUse Write|Edit). Scans content destined for `.planning/` files for prompt-injection patterns and invisible Unicode. Advisory only. Always on.
- **`hooks/gsd-workflow-guard.js`** (PreToolUse Write|Edit). Warns when files are edited outside a GSD command context. Opt-in via `.planning/config.json` `{"hooks":{"workflow_guard":true}}` (default off).
- **`hooks/gsd-read-guard.js`** (PreToolUse Write|Edit). Read-before-edit advisory for sub-runtimes. Auto-no-ops in Claude Code (which natively enforces read-before-edit), so this hook is dormant by default for plugin users. Included as defense for cross-runtime configurations.
- **`hooks/gsd-read-injection-scanner.js`** (PostToolUse Read). Scans file content returned by the Read tool for injection patterns plus summarisation-survival patterns. Severity-tagged (LOW/HIGH) advisory. Always on.
- **`hooks/gsd-validate-commit.sh`** (PreToolUse Bash). Enforces Conventional Commits format on `git commit -m '...'` invocations. Blocks (exit 2) with typed code (`CONVENTIONAL_COMMITS_VIOLATION` / `COMMIT_SUBJECT_TOO_LONG`) on violation. Opt-in via `.planning/config.json` `{"hooks":{"community":true}}`.
- **`hooks/gsd-phase-boundary.sh`** (PostToolUse Write|Edit|MultiEdit). Emits `additionalContext` reminder when `.planning/` files are modified, suggesting STATE.md should be reviewed. Opt-in via `hooks.community: true`.
- **`hooks/gsd-context-monitor.js`** (PostToolUse broad matcher). Reads statusline-bridge metrics from `/tmp/claude-ctx-${session_id}.json` and injects context-usage warnings (<=35% remaining: WARNING, <=25% remaining: CRITICAL). On CRITICAL with active GSD project, spawns `gsd-tools.cjs state record-session` as a fire-and-forget breadcrumb for `/gsd:resume-work`. Always on unless `.planning/config.json` `{"hooks":{"context_warnings":false}}`.
- **`hooks/gsd-session-state.sh`** (SessionStart). Injects STATE.md head as `additionalContext` on session start. Opt-in via `hooks.community: true`.
- **`hooks/lib/git-cmd.js`**, token-walk git subcommand classifier (required by `gsd-validate-commit.sh`, handles env-prefix, `-C path`, full-path git invocations).

### Plugin patch
- `#PLUGIN-HOOK-CONTEXT-MONITOR` (`hooks/gsd-context-monitor.js`). Upstream resolves `gsd-tools.cjs` via `path.join(__dirname, '..', 'get-shit-done', 'bin', 'gsd-tools.cjs')` (assumes the upstream `<runtime-config>/get-shit-done/` layout). Plugin layout is flat (`hooks/` and `bin/` are siblings), so the patch drops the `'get-shit-done'` segment and additionally honors `GSD_TOOLS_PATH` env override for testing.
- Added to `feedback_plugin_patches_inventory.md` alongside the existing `#PLUGIN-AGENTS-DIR`, `#PLUGIN-MODEL-CATALOG-PATH`, and `#PLUGIN-WRAPPER-ENV-EXPORT` patches.

### Architecture (hybrid hooks)
- Cross-cutting events (SessionStart auto-resume + migration check, PreCompact checkpoint, PostToolUse periodic checkpoint, Stop rate-limit nudge) continue routing through `bin/gsd-tools.cjs hook <type>`. These share helper imports and would duplicate state if split.
- Tool-specific guards run as individual scripts. Each script is single-responsibility, self-contained, and uses the same plugin-path-stale Node resolver as the dispatcher (so a mid-session plugin upgrade doesn't break in-flight hooks).
- Both `SessionStart` and `PreToolUse Edit|Write` events now have multiple registered hooks (existing dispatcher + new individual scripts). All run independently per Claude Code's hook contract.

### Excluded from this pass
- **`gsd-check-update.js`** (upstream), not pulled in. Its `detectConfigDir()` looks for `get-shit-done/VERSION` which does not exist in the plugin's flat layout, and it duplicates the `/plugin marketplace update` flow that's already the plugin's canonical update mechanism. Decision deferred indefinitely.
- `gsd-statusline.js`, `gsd-update-banner.js`. UI surfaces, separate concern. Can be evaluated for a future release once the statusline contract aligns.

### Tests
- New: `tests/hooks-smoke.test.cjs`, spawn-based smoke test for all 8 hooks. Verifies each script parses, handles a representative event payload without crashing, and produces the expected JSON envelope (or silence) for advisory-on vs. advisory-off cases. Layout patch on `gsd-context-monitor.js` verified by inline grep.
- Regression fence: `tests/mcp-stdio-framing.test.cjs` and `tests/workspace-json-integration.test.cjs` still pass unchanged.

## [2.42.5] - 2026-05-11

Hotfix — restores the *"GSD agents not installed"* false-positive suppression that was supposed to land in v2.40.1 and got partially undone by subsequent upstream syncs. Reported via `/gsd:new-project` from a fresh project tree: the SDK warned to run `npx get-shit-done-cc@latest --global` even though the plugin already ships all 33 agents.

### Fixed
- **`bin/gsd-sdk` + `bin/gsd-sdk.cmd`** (`#PLUGIN-WRAPPER-ENV-EXPORT`) — both wrappers now `export CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` and `GSD_AGENTS_DIR` (when unset) before exec'ing `node`. Root cause: the bundled SDK's `resolveAgentsDir()` in `sdk/src/query/helpers.ts` checks `GSD_AGENTS_DIR` or runtime-config-dir paths — never `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`. And Claude Code does NOT set `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` in Bash tool environments (only in skill/agent dispatch envs). So the SDK couldn't locate the bundled `<plugin_root>/agents/` from a Bash subprocess. The wrappers already self-derived the plugin root to find `sdk/dist/cli.js`; they just weren't propagating it. Caller-set values for either env var are still respected (the patch only exports when the variable is unset).
- This is the workflow-layer companion to the v2.40.1 `bin/lib/core.cjs::getAgentsDir()` patch. Two layers of defense now cover the plugin-flat-layout case for any caller that goes through the wrapper.

### Verified
- `gsd-sdk query init.new-project` returns `agents_installed: true` from any cwd, with no env vars set
- Caller-set `GSD_AGENTS_DIR` is respected (not overridden)
- MCP regression test (issue #3) passes
- workspace.json integration test (issue #5/PR #6) 22/22 passes

### Notes
- Earlier in this session we verified that Claude Code's Bash tool environment lacks `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`. That property is the load-bearing reason this patch is necessary. If Claude Code starts setting `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` for Bash tool calls in a future version, this patch becomes redundant but stays harmless.
- Adds `#PLUGIN-WRAPPER-ENV-EXPORT` to the plugin patches inventory.

## [2.42.4] - 2026-05-11  (based on upstream GSD 1.41.2)

Upstream patch sync — picks up GSD 1.41.2 (released 2026-05-10). Plugin patches in `bin/lib/core.cjs` and `bin/gsd-tools.cjs` untouched upstream this cycle (regression-grep verified intact). The `#PLUGIN-MODEL-CATALOG-PATH` patch shape evolved — upstream replaced the single-path require with a 3-candidate resolver; folded the plugin's flat-layout path into upstream's candidate list as the new first entry.

### Changed
- **Version bump** — plugin `2.42.3 → 2.42.4`.
- **`bin/lib/{config-schema,config,phase,state}.cjs`** refreshed wholesale.
- **`bin/lib/model-catalog.cjs`** ([upstream #3293](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3293)) — replaced single-path require with prioritised candidate list (install-path → source-repo dev path → `GSD_MODEL_CATALOG` env override). Plugin patch prepends the flat-layout 2-level traversal as candidate #0; upstream's three candidates kept intact below.
- **`agents/{gsd-intel-updater,gsd-planner,gsd-verifier}.md`** refreshed.
- **`workflows/{execute-phase,execute-plan,forensics,plan-phase,ship,verify-phase}.md`** refreshed.

### Fixed
Upstream bug fixes flowing through automatically:
- **State write integrity** ([#3291](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3291)) — `state record-metric`, `state add-decision`, and `state add-blocker` no longer silently lose data. Missing target sections auto-created with canonical scaffolds; all three verbs honor `--ws <name>` workstream routing.
- **Verifier hardening — no pass with unresolved markers** ([#3343](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3343)) — phase verification no longer passes with unresolved `TBD` / `FIXME` / `XXX` markers in phase-modified source files. Same-line issue/PR refs and `DEF-*` IDs remain valid formal deferrals.
- **Verifier runs probe scripts directly** ([#3350](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3350)) — no longer accepts SUMMARY-reported probe PASS markers as evidence.
- **Human-needed verification no longer completes phases** ([#3339](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3339)) — SDK keeps `human_needed` and missing verification results pending; `check.ship-ready` only passes explicit pass states.
- **Executor stall detection** ([#3329](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3329)) — safe-resume contracts surface partial-plan drift before dispatching duplicate executor work.
- **`phase remove --force` renumbering** ([#3367](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3367)) — integer phase removal preserves later ROADMAP progress rows and headings instead of collapsing to the removed phase number.
- **`detect-custom-files` scans `skills/`** ([#3318](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3318)) — SDK custom-file detection back in parity with `bin/gsd-tools.cjs`, preventing user-added skills from being silently destroyed during `/gsd:update`.
- **`/gsd:plan-phase` deep-work rules** ([#3326](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3326)) — planners keep action blocks as directive prose, avoid fenced implementation dumps.
- **Codex install hardening** — `gsd-sdk` installs reliably on Windows ([#3282](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3282)); `gsd-tools.cjs` and CJS fallback bridge work post-install via the new `bin/shared/model-catalog.json` path ([#3293](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3293)); `get-shit-done-cc --codex` accepts Codex `hooks.state.*` trust tables ([#3289](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3289)); legacy GSD-managed hooks.json update hooks cleaned up after writing the TOML SessionStart hook ([#3364](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3364)).
- **Gemini install/conversion** — Gemini install output valid on Windows PowerShell, agent conversion drops Claude-only `AskUserQuestion` / `ask_user` tool metadata ([#3368](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3368)); Gemini and Antigravity conversion drops Claude-only agent dispatcher tools ([#3349](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3349)).
- **SDK resolve-model / init.progress** ([#3361](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3361)) — Codex runtime override models reported before `resolve_model_ids: "omit"`.
- **Installer SDK readiness detects stale `gsd-sdk` executables** earlier on PATH ([#3363](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3363)).
- See full upstream release notes: <https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/releases/tag/v1.41.2>.

### Removed
- Upstream removed the vestigial `Layout detection returned 'unknown'` line from `gsd-intel-updater` on non-GSD-framework projects ([#3299](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3299)). Plugin follows.

### Plugin patches — 2 preserved verbatim, 1 evolved
- **`bin/lib/core.cjs`** — `resolveGsdRoot` / `resolveGsdDataDir` / `resolveGsdAsset` + `getAgentsDir` w/ `GSD_AGENTS_DIR` override. Untouched upstream this cycle (regression-grep verified intact).
- **`bin/gsd-tools.cjs`** — `migrate` / `write-phase-memory` / `checkpoint` / `hook` cases. Untouched upstream this cycle (regression-grep verified intact).
- **`bin/lib/model-catalog.cjs`** (`#PLUGIN-MODEL-CATALOG-PATH`) — patch shape evolved. v2.42.2 used a try-plugin-first-with-existsSync-fallback pattern (since the upstream baseline was a single `require()`). v2.42.4 folds the plugin's flat-layout candidate into upstream's new prioritised candidate list as entry #0. Cleaner, integrates with upstream's `_catalogLastErr` diagnostic chain.

### Notes
- Bundled SDK at `sdk/dist/cli.js` still on `v1.50.0-canary.0`. Will refresh on the next significant SDK update.
- v1.42.0 GA still pending — rc2 published 2026-05-10 22:10 UTC, 21 min after v1.41.2 GA. Same rolling-hotfix-while-RC pattern as v1.41.1.
- This is the second sync this week. Cadence is fast; consider folding multiple patches into a single sync next time if upstream patches keep landing daily.

## [2.42.3] - 2026-05-10

Adds optional `agents.workspace.json` SessionStart integration. Architectural discussion in [#5](https://github.com/jnuyens/gsd-plugin/issues/5); implementation in [PR #6](https://github.com/jnuyens/gsd-plugin/pull/6).

### Added
- **Optional `agents.workspace.json` read on SessionStart** ([#5](https://github.com/jnuyens/gsd-plugin/issues/5)). When `.agents/agents.workspace.json` (or the legacy `agents.workspace.json` root path) is present, the plugin injects structured codebase intelligence into the model's context:
  - Empirically-fragile files (filtered to `fragility ≥ 0.7`, with `aiModificationCount` vs `humanModificationCount` history)
  - Detected framework manifest (filtered to `confidence ≥ 0.7`)
  - Human-annotated fragile files and co-change patterns
- **Spec scope honored**: only reads the four agreed buckets — `generated.frameworkManifest`, `generated.fileIndex`, `manual.fragileFiles`, `manual.coChangePatterns`. PROJECT.md remains canonical for `manual.conventions` / `techStack` / `description` (the overlapping fields).
- **Strict major-version gating**: same major version loads, different major refuses with clear error message *"workspace.json requires version X but this plugin supports 0.1. Update gsd-plugin or regenerate your workspace.json."* No silent-corruption-via-load-future-version risk.
- **Configurable cap**: `gsd.workspace_json_max_files` in `.planning/config.json` controls how many fragile files surface (default 5).
- **Spec reference**: <https://workspacejson.dev/spec>

### Zero-token-impact convention
The integration adds an `existsSync` syscall to SessionStart. If the file is absent, the plugin behaves identically to v2.42.2 — no context injected, no tokens consumed. This convention now applies to all future optional integrations as a design rule: opt-in features must not cost anything to users who haven't opted in.

### Safety
- **Prompt-injection sanitization** via `bin/lib/security.cjs`'s `sanitizeForPrompt`. Every user-controlled string in `workspace.json` (file paths, framework names, fragility reasons, co-change notes) is stripped of zero-width characters and neutralized for `<system>` / `[INST]` / `<<SYS>>` markers before injection.
- **DoS guards**: input arrays/objects capped before processing (10K index entries, 100 framework entries, 500 fragile files, 200 co-change patterns).
- **Fail-soft read path**: never throws. Missing file, malformed JSON, schema mismatch, version mismatch — all return `null` with a clear stderr message; SessionStart behavior is unaffected.

### Credits
- **[@qmarcelle](https://github.com/qmarcelle)** — first external contributor to substantive plugin code. Wrote the implementation, the 538-line test suite, and the security/DoS hardening passes (the latter unsolicited).

### Files
- `bin/lib/workspace-json.cjs` (new, 176 lines) — the reader/parser/version-gate module
- `bin/gsd-tools.cjs` (+27 lines) — wires into the existing SessionStart hook
- `tests/workspace-json-integration.test.cjs` (new, 538 lines) — 22 test scenarios

### Notes
- Verified end-to-end on `debian:trixie` install-smoke + Check drift; 22/22 local tests pass.
- The integration carries forward all existing protections from v2.40.2 (MCP stdio framing) and v2.42.1 (bundled SDK with no external prereq).

## [2.42.2] - 2026-05-10  (based on upstream GSD 1.41.1)

Upstream patch sync — picks up GSD 1.41.1 (released 2026-05-09). Plugin-only patches in `bin/lib/core.cjs` (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT path resolution helpers + agent-dir override) and `bin/gsd-tools.cjs` (`migrate` / `write-phase-memory` / `checkpoint` / `hook` cases) preserved via 3-way merge. One new plugin patch in `bin/lib/model-catalog.cjs` for the flat plugin layout — same fallback pattern as `getAgentsDir()`.

### Added
- **`bin/lib/model-catalog.cjs`** + **`sdk/shared/model-catalog.json`** ([upstream #3230](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3230)) — shared model catalog as the single source of truth for agent profiles and runtime tier defaults. Replaces four drifting truths (CJS `model-profiles`, SDK `config-query`, `settings-advanced.md`, session-runner) with a JSON file consumed by both packages via thin adapters. `resolve-model` now covers all 33 shipped agents; unknown-agent fallback is profile-semantic (`quality→opus`, `budget→haiku`, `balanced/adaptive→sonnet`) instead of hardcoded sonnet.
- See full upstream release notes: <https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/releases/tag/v1.41.1>.

### Changed
- **Version bump** — plugin `2.42.1 → 2.42.2`.
- **`bin/lib/{config-schema,model-profiles,phase,state}.cjs`** refreshed wholesale. `model-profiles.cjs` thinned by ~95 lines as it now reads from the shared catalog.
- **`bin/lib/core.cjs`** got 87 lines smaller (-95/+8) — a chunk migrated into `model-catalog.cjs`. Plugin patches re-applied.
- **`bin/gsd-tools.cjs`** picked up the dotted-canonical-form shim ([#3243](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3243)) — callers using `state.update` (dotted) now resolve correctly. Plugin's 4 patched cases unaffected.
- **`agents/{gsd-code-fixer,gsd-code-reviewer}.md`** — `BL-` / `blocker:` accepted as Critical-tier; macOS BSD-grep portability fix.
- **`workflows/{code-review,execute-phase,plant-seed,settings-advanced}.md`** refreshed.

### Fixed
Upstream bug fixes flowing through automatically:
- **Wave 0 plans no longer collapse into wave 1** ([#3276](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3276)) — `phase-plan-index` switched from trusting the `wave:` frontmatter to a Kahn topological sort over `depends_on`. Plus a parsed `wave: 0` is preserved instead of being coerced by `parseInt(...) || 1`.
- **`execute-phase` step 5.5 documents the cross-wave-deviation cleanup tail** ([#3273](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3273)) — deviation cleanup is no longer silently skipped between waves.
- **`state snapshot` prefers YAML frontmatter for canonical fields** ([#3275](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3275)) — body table cells like `**Status:** to ✅ COMPLETE` no longer override the correct frontmatter value.
- **`state.update` on body-only changes preserves curated `progress.*` frontmatter** ([#3252](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3252)).
- **`phase.add` honors `--dry-run` and rejects unknown flags** ([#3246](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3246)).
- **Native `--help` is non-mutating** ([#3272](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3272)) — dispatcher-level guard short-circuits to a help stub on `--help` / `-h`.
- **CJS dispatcher accepts the canonical dotted command form** ([#3248](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3248)).
- **`extractFrontmatter` is anchored at file start** ([#3247](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3247)).
- **`code-review` SUMMARY parser hardened** ([#3274](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3274)) — `BL-` / `blocker:` accepted as Critical-tier-equivalent to `CR-*`.
- **`/gsd:capture --seed` one-shot contract restored** ([#3250](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3250)).
- **Codex install accepts TOML float values** ([#3254](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3254)).
- **`✓ GSD SDK ready` only prints once SDK is genuinely reachable** ([#3249](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3249)).
- **`config-set model_overrides.<agent-id>` accepted** ([#3253](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/pull/3253)).

### Plugin patches preserved + 1 new
- **`bin/lib/core.cjs`** — `resolveGsdRoot` / `resolveGsdDataDir` / `resolveGsdAsset` + the patched `getAgentsDir` reading `GSD_AGENTS_DIR`. Reapplied.
- **`bin/gsd-tools.cjs`** — `migrate` / `write-phase-memory` / `checkpoint` / `hook` cases. Reapplied.
- **`bin/lib/model-catalog.cjs`** (NEW patch — `#PLUGIN-MODEL-CATALOG-PATH`) — upstream's `../../../sdk/shared/model-catalog.json` traversal lands one level too high in the plugin's flat layout. Patched to try `../../sdk/shared/` first, fall back to `../../../sdk/shared/` for upstream installs. Same fallback pattern as `getAgentsDir()`.

### Notes
- Bundled SDK at `sdk/dist/cli.js` still reports `v1.50.0-canary.0`; upstream is at canary.2 but the canary line is separate from the GA line. Will refresh when v1.50.0 stabilises (or v1.42.0 GA arrives, expected in 3-5 days).
- Install-smoke CI ran green on this commit in `debian:trixie` container.

## [2.42.1] - 2026-05-07

Hotfix that completes v2.42.0's "no external prereq" promise. v2.42.0 shipped `sdk/dist/cli.js` (~3 KB tsc shim) without the ~81 MB of runtime npm dependencies it imports (`ws`, `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, transitives). On a truly fresh box (no prior `npx get-shit-done-cc`) the bundled `gsd-sdk` failed at module-resolution time. **Caught by smoke-testing v2.42.0 on a fresh Debian 13 box** (`192.168.1.170`) — the user's existing macOS/laptop installs had an external `gsd-sdk` already on `PATH` so the bug was invisible there.

### Fixed
- **`sdk/dist/cli.js`** — switched the SDK build from plain `tsc` to `tsc && esbuild --bundle --platform=node --format=esm --outfile=dist/cli.js --allow-overwrite`, with a `createRequire` shim banner so CJS deps (ws's transitive `require()` calls) work inside the ESM output. Result: `dist/cli.js` is now a single 1.5 MB self-contained file with all runtime deps inlined. No `node_modules` needed at plugin runtime. Verified against 6 test scenarios on fresh Debian 13 with no prior GSD install: `--version`, PATH-based resolution, `query state.load`, `query commands`, MCP regression test, and workflow-style callsite simulation. All pass.
- **`sdk/package.json`** — added `bundle` script and updated `build` to chain it after `tsc`. Added `esbuild ^0.28.0` as devDependency (build-time only, not shipped).

### Notes
- Plugin tree size grew by ~+1.5 MB (the bundled `cli.js`). Total cost is still ~80 MB less than committing `node_modules/` would have been.
- v2.42.0 is being **superseded immediately** rather than left in the wild. Anyone who already pulled v2.42.0 should run `/plugin marketplace update gsd-plugin` to surface this fix.

## [2.42.0] - 2026-05-07

**No more `gsd-sdk` prerequisite.** The plugin now bundles the GSD SDK inside its own tree, so `/plugin install gsd@gsd-plugin` is genuinely the only install step. Closes [#4](https://github.com/jnuyens/gsd-plugin/issues/4) at the architectural level (v2.41.1's README fix corrected the documentation; this release removes the requirement that documentation was trying to describe).

### Added
- **`sdk/`** — full GSD SDK source tree synced from upstream `gsd-build/get-shit-done@v1.41.0` (`src/`, `prompts/`, `scripts/`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `package-lock.json`).
- **`sdk/dist/`** — pre-built TypeScript output (`tsc` against the committed `src/`). Plugin commits `dist/` even though upstream gitignores it: plugin users won't run `npm install` / `npm run build`, so the binary needs to be ready immediately after `/plugin install`.
- **`bin/gsd-sdk`** — POSIX shell wrapper that `exec`s `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/sdk/dist/cli.js`. Falls back to script-relative resolution if `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is unset, and to an external `gsd-sdk` on `PATH` if the bundled one is somehow missing (preserves legacy install path as a safety net).
- **`bin/gsd-sdk.cmd`** — Windows batch wrapper with the same logic.

### Changed
- **README** — replaced the "Prerequisites: install the GSD SDK CLI" subsection (added in v2.41.1 as a stop-gap) with a "No prerequisites" notice. Migration §2 now correctly tells users it's safe to `npm uninstall -g get-shit-done-cc` after upgrading to v2.42.0+.
- **Versioning rule exception** — bumping minor (`2.41.x → 2.42.0`) for a plugin-only feature even though upstream is still at `1.41.0`. Standard rule (`plugin_minor = upstream_minor`) resumes when the next upstream sync lands; if upstream then ships `1.42.0`, that sync goes out as `2.43.0` to avoid collision.

### Plugin patches
Two SDK source patches were needed for the plugin's flat directory layout:
- **`sdk/src/query/state-project-load.ts`** — adds `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/core.cjs` as the first probe candidate. Upstream's resolver expects `<root>/get-shit-done/bin/lib/core.cjs`; the plugin's flat layout is `<plugin_root>/bin/lib/core.cjs`. Tagged `[PLUGIN PATCH]` inline.
- **`sdk/src/query-gsd-tools-path.ts`** — same patch for `gsd-tools.cjs`. Tagged `[PLUGIN PATCH]` inline.

### How resolution works (no callsite rewrite was needed)
Claude Code automatically prepends each plugin's `bin/` directory to `PATH` for every `Bash` tool call. Existing `gsd-sdk query ...` invocations across all 500+ workflow and skill callsites resolve to the bundled wrapper for plugin-only users, with **zero rewrite** required. Users with an external `gsd-sdk` already on `PATH` (e.g. `/opt/homebrew/bin` from a prior `npx get-shit-done-cc` install) keep using their external one because plugin `bin/` is appended (not prepended) by Claude Code — no behavior change for legacy users.

### Verified
- `gsd-sdk --version` → `v1.50.0-canary.0` (bundled, was the npm-published `0.1.0`)
- `gsd-sdk query state.load` returns valid project config block
- `gsd-sdk query roadmap.analyze` returns project milestones
- `gsd-sdk query commands` returns full command list
- `node tests/mcp-stdio-framing.test.cjs` still passes (regression fence from v2.40.2 unaffected)

### Notes
- Bundle adds ~6.8 MB to the plugin tree (`sdk/dist/` 3.9 MB + `sdk/src/` 2.8 MB + prompts/scripts). Plugin total still well under typical Claude Code plugin sizes.
- Long-term: route workflow scripts through the plugin's own MCP server instead of shelling out at all. Tracked separately; this release is the architectural prerequisite that makes the routing achievable.

## [2.41.1] - 2026-05-07

Documentation hotfix — corrects a README instruction that left migrating users (and any new user without a prior `npx get-shit-done-cc` install) with broken `/gsd:*` commands.

### Fixed
- **`README.md` — Manual migration §2** ([#4](https://github.com/jnuyens/gsd-plugin/issues/4)) — earlier versions told users to `npm uninstall -g get-shit-done-cc`, which removes the `gsd-sdk` binary that the plugin's workflow scripts shell out to in 500+ places. After following the step, every `/gsd:*` command failed with `command not found: gsd-sdk`. §2 now explicitly tells users to keep the package installed (with a "this README used to be wrong" callout) and points at the long-term plan to route workflows through the plugin's MCP server.
- **`README.md` — Installation prerequisites** — added a new "Prerequisites: install the GSD SDK CLI" subsection before Step 1, with the exact `npm install -g get-shit-done-cc` command and a verification snippet (`which gsd-sdk` / `gsd-sdk --version`). This closes the same gap for fresh installs that issue #4 surfaced for migrating ones.

### Notes
- Reported by @ThomasHezard ([#4](https://github.com/jnuyens/gsd-plugin/issues/4), 2026-04-28) with a Claude-on-behalf-of-user investigation that pinpointed exact line numbers and counted the `gsd-sdk` ref footprint. Confirmed independently by @herman925 (2026-05-06).
- This is a documentation-only release; no behavior change in plugin code. The architectural fix (routing workflow scripts through the plugin's MCP server so `gsd-sdk` is no longer a separate prerequisite) remains tracked at [#4](https://github.com/jnuyens/gsd-plugin/issues/4).

## [2.41.0] - 2026-05-07  (based on upstream GSD 1.41.0)

Upstream minor sync — picks up GSD 1.41.0 (released 2026-05-07). Plugin-only patches in `bin/lib/core.cjs` (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT path resolution helpers `resolveGsdRoot` / `resolveGsdDataDir` / `resolveGsdAsset` + agent-dir override `getAgentsDir` reading `GSD_AGENTS_DIR`) preserved via 3-way merge. `bin/gsd-tools.cjs` untouched upstream this cycle; plugin's `migrate` / `write-phase-memory` / `checkpoint` / `hook` cases verified intact via regression grep.

### Added
- **`/gsd:mvp-phase` workflow** — new MVP-phase command (vertical-slice planning + TDD execution + UAT verification). Includes 8 new references (`mvp-concepts`, `planner-mvp-mode`, `execute-mvp-tdd`, `verify-mvp-mode`, `spidr-splitting`, `skeleton-template`, `user-story-template`, `worktree-path-safety`). New plugin skill `skills/mvp-phase/SKILL.md` exposes the command.
- **3 new workflow bodies** for existing skills: `workflows/add-backlog.md`, `workflows/debug.md`, `workflows/thread.md` (the skills already existed in the plugin; upstream now ships the workflow files they reference).
- **`bin/lib/runtime-homes.cjs`** — runtime-aware `globalSkillsBase` resolution (replaces hardcoded path, upstream #3126).
- 7 agent-prompt updates: `gsd-codebase-mapper`, `gsd-debug-session-manager`, `gsd-executor`, `gsd-plan-checker`, `gsd-planner`, `gsd-roadmapper`, `gsd-verifier`.
- See full upstream release notes: <https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/releases/tag/v1.41.0>.

### Changed
- **Version bump** — plugin `2.40.2 → 2.41.0` per `plugin_minor = upstream_minor` versioning (README § Versioning).
- **`workflows/extract_learnings.md` renamed to `workflows/extract-learnings.md`** (snake → kebab; git history preserved via `git mv`).
- **33 workflows refreshed** at top level: `ai-integration-phase`, `audit-fix`, `audit-milestone`, `code-review-fix`, `code-review`, `diagnose-issues`, `discuss-phase-assumptions`, `discuss-phase`, `docs-update`, `execute-phase`, `execute-plan`, `explore`, `help`, `import`, `ingest-docs`, `manager`, `map-codebase`, `new-milestone`, `new-project`, `next`, `plan-phase`, `progress`, `quick`, `resume-project`, `scan`, `secure-phase`, `settings`, `stats`, `ui-phase`, `ui-review`, `update`, `validate-phase`, `verify-work`. Notable: `quick.md` (history-based resurrection guard), `plan-phase.md` (removed stale OpenCode `agent:` directive #3156), `execute-phase.md` + sub-step files (cwd-drift sentinel + absolute-path guard #3097/#3099).
- **3 nested workflow files refreshed**: `discuss-phase/modes/advisor.md`, `execute-phase/steps/codebase-drift-gate.md`, `execute-phase/steps/per-plan-worktree-gate.md`.
- **12 `bin/lib/` modules refreshed** wholesale (no plugin patches in any of them): `artifacts`, `config-schema`, `graphify`, `init`, `milestone`, `phase-command-router`, `phase`, `profile-output`, `roadmap`, `state-command-router`, `state`, `verify`.
- **`templates/README.md`** updated.

### Fixed
- Upstream bug fixes flowing through automatically: milestone version-resolution (#3109), STATE narrative-tail normalization (#3122), `roadmap.cjs` plan-count for nested layout (#3128), `state.begin-phase` idempotency (#3127), workflow contract validation (#3151), and statusline numeric-100 / next_phases parsing (#3154).

## [2.40.2] - 2026-05-07

Hotfix — restores the bundled MCP server's stdio transport so `claude mcp list` reports `gsd: ✓ Connected` and the eight `gsd_*` MCP tools become reachable.

### Fixed
- **`mcp/server.cjs`** (#3) — switched the stdio transport to newline-delimited JSON, which is what the MCP spec and current Claude Code MCP clients send and expect. The previous LSP-style `Content-Length:` framing silently dropped every request: the reader required `\r\n\r\n` that ndjson never produces, and the writer emitted headers ndjson clients won't parse as a response boundary. Reader now tries ndjson first and falls back to Content-Length framing only when a complete LSP header block arrives before the next newline (safe for any legacy transport still emitting it). Verified locally: `initialize` returns 176 bytes, `tools/list` returns all 8 tools.

### Notes
- Reported and patched by @Sovereigntymind (the project's first external contributor!) and confirmed on macOS / 2.40.1 by @jesse-smith. The fix is the contributor's tested patch applied verbatim, with the LSP path kept as a fallback rather than removed.
- Slash commands were unaffected by this bug because they read `.planning/` files directly and don't go through the MCP server.

## [2.40.1] - 2026-05-06

Hotfix — suppresses a false-positive "GSD subagents are not installed" warning that appeared after `/gsd:new-project` and `/gsd:new-milestone` for plugin users.

### Fixed
- **`bin/lib/core.cjs::getAgentsDir()`** (#PLUGIN-AGENTS-DIR) — upstream's `__dirname/../../../agents` traversal assumes the upstream `<root>/get-shit-done/bin/lib/` layout and lands one level too high in the plugin's flattened `<plugin_root>/bin/lib/` layout. Patched to prefer `path.join(resolveGsdRoot(), 'agents')` when that directory exists, so `checkAgentsInstalled()` finds the bundled agents.
- **`workflows/new-project.md` + `workflows/new-milestone.md`** — the `agents_installed: false` warning gate now first overrides the flag for plugin users (`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` set + bundled `agents/gsd-planner.md` present), and the fallback warning text clarifies that plugin users can ignore it. The previous warning recommended `npx get-shit-done-cc@latest --global`, which the plugin's `migrations/legacy-cleanup.cjs::autoMigrate` actively undoes — bad advice for plugin users.
- **`workflows/quick.md`** — exports `GSD_AGENTS_DIR=$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/agents` before the `gsd-sdk query init.quick` call so the SDK's bundled (un-patched) `core.cjs` consults the plugin's agents directory.

### Notes
- Patches are tagged inline with `[PLUGIN PATCH]` / `#PLUGIN-AGENTS-DIR` markers and recorded in the persistent plugin-patches inventory so future upstream syncs preserve them.
- This is a plugin-side fix only. Standalone `gsd-sdk` invocations outside the plugin's workflows still report the false-negative, because the SDK ships its own bundled `core.cjs` from the npx cache and that copy is not patched. A future upstream PR can land the same `getAgentsDir()` fix at source.

## [2.40.0] - 2026-05-03  (based on upstream GSD 1.40.0)

Upstream minor sync — picks up upstream GSD 1.40.0 (released 2026-05-02). Plugin-only patches in `bin/lib/core.cjs` (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT path resolution helpers — `resolveGsdRoot` / `resolveGsdDataDir` / `resolveGsdAsset`) and `bin/gsd-tools.cjs` (`migrate` / `write-phase-memory` / `checkpoint` / `hook` command branches) preserved via 3-way merge.

### Added
- **Upstream v1.40.0 source tree** — full tree-copy of changed files in `bin/`, `bin/lib/`, `references/`, `templates/`, `agents/`, `workflows/`.
- **`bin/check-latest-version.cjs`** — new upstream helper for latest-version detection.
- **`bin/verify-reapply-patches.cjs`** — new upstream helper that verifies plugin patches survived a sync (now bundled — useful tooling for future syncs).
- See full upstream release notes: <https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/releases/tag/v1.40.0>.

### Changed
- **Version bump** — plugin `2.39.1 → 2.40.0` per `plugin_major = upstream_major + 1` versioning (README § Versioning). Minor bump mirrors upstream's `1.39.1 → 1.40.0` increment.
- **Workflow bodies updated** — 17 workflows refreshed: add-todo, audit-milestone, check-todos, code-review, code-review-fix, discovery-phase, execute-phase, execute-plan, help, list-workspaces, new-workspace, plan-phase, profile-user, progress, reapply-patches, resume-project, transition, update.
- **References refreshed** — context-budget.md, continuation-format.md, model-profiles.md.
- **Templates refreshed** — README.md, discovery.md, state.md.
- **Agent body** — `agents/gsd-code-fixer.md` updated.

### Removed
- **`workflows/research-phase.md`** — upstream removed `research-phase` workflow in 1.40.0 (consolidated into other phases). Plugin follows.

### Added
- **Rate-limit fallback hint** — new `Stop` hook tails the session transcript and, when it detects a rate-limit message ("You've hit your limit", "usage limit", "rate limit"), prints a bordered hint pointing at the no-token recovery path (`/exit` then `gsd-resume-at HH:MM` from a plain terminal). Best-effort detection because Claude Code renders its rate-limit message before any plugin code runs; the Stop event fires after, giving users a one-paste recovery the next time they look at the terminal. Same example also added to `skills/resume-at/SKILL.md` (No-token fallback callout) and `bin/gsd-resume-at` (head comment + runtime `--help`).

## [2.39.1] - 2026-05-01  (based on upstream GSD 1.39.1)

Upstream hotfix sync — picks up upstream GSD 1.39.1 (released 2026-05-01) on top of yesterday's v1.39.0 sync. Hotfix scope: `bin/gsd-tools.cjs` (1 line — adds `'skills'` to `GSD_MANAGED_DIRS` in `detect-custom-files`, PR #2942), `bin/lib/config-schema.cjs` + `bin/lib/config.cjs` (~20 lines — `SCHEMA_DEFAULTS` for `context_window`, PR #2944), `references/git-integration.md` (worktree hook policy, PR #2924), and roughly a dozen `workflows/*.md` files. Plugin-only patches in `bin/lib/core.cjs` (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT path resolution helpers — `resolveGsdRoot` / `resolveGsdDataDir` / `resolveGsdAsset`) and `bin/gsd-tools.cjs` (`migrate` / `write-phase-memory` / `checkpoint` / `hook` command branches) preserved verbatim. Upstream did not modify `bin/lib/core.cjs` between 1.39.0 → 1.39.1, so the plugin's patched copy was kept as-is.

### Added
- **Upstream v1.39.1 hotfix bundle** — full tree-copy of changed files. Notable upstream additions surfaced via the sync:
  - **`config-get` returns schema default for `context_window`** when the field is absent from the merged config (upstream #2944, via new `SCHEMA_DEFAULTS` table in `bin/lib/config-schema.cjs` + matching lookup in `bin/lib/config.cjs`).
  - **`detect-custom-files` adds `skills/` to `GSD_MANAGED_DIRS`** so plugin-managed skill content is properly tracked (upstream #2942).
  - **`--minimal` install profile across all runtimes + Claude local manifest fix** (upstream #2940).
  - **`code-review --fix` dispatch** wired in the workflow body (upstream #2947).
  - **`sketch --wrap-up` flag dispatch** (upstream #2949).
  - **`spike --wrap-up` flag dispatch** (upstream #2948).
  - **Deterministic Step 5 verification gate for `/gsd:reapply-patches`** (upstream #2969).
  - **npm-style `gsd-sdk` shim on Windows under `--sdk install`** (upstream #2962).
  - **`agent-skills` emits raw `<agent_skills>` block** instead of JSON-wrapped string (upstream #2917). Affects planner/executor input parsing — verified post-sync that plugin's `gsd-sdk query agent-skills <type>` consumers still parse correctly.
  - **`claude+global` post-install instructs restart and skill fallback** (upstream #2957).
  - **`help.md` aligned with post-#2824 skill consolidation** (upstream #2954).
  - **Stale deleted-command refs cleaned up in workflow files** (upstream #2950).
- See full upstream release notes: <https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/releases/tag/v1.39.1>.

### Changed
- **Version bump** — plugin `2.39.0 → 2.39.1` per `plugin_major = upstream_major + 1` versioning (README § Versioning). Patch bump mirrors upstream's hotfix increment.
- **README counts** — unchanged (82 slash commands, 85 workflow bodies, 33 agent definitions). The hotfix modified existing files in tree-copy scope without adding/removing any.

### Fixed
- **Per-agent branch HEAD asserted before worktree commits** (upstream #2924) — prevents accidental commits to the wrong branch when worktrees drift. The accompanying `references/git-integration.md` change reverses the previous "use `--no-verify` in parallel agents" guidance: hooks now run normally on the introducing commit; opt-out is via the explicit `workflow.worktree_skip_hooks=true` config flag.

## [2.39.0] - 2026-05-01  (based on upstream GSD 1.39.0)

Upstream sync release — picks up upstream GSD 1.39.0 source-tree changes (workflows, references, templates, contexts, bin/lib utilities, bin/gsd-tools.cjs) while preserving plugin-only patches in `bin/lib/core.cjs` (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT path resolution helpers — `resolveGsdRoot` / `resolveGsdDataDir` / `resolveGsdAsset`) and `bin/gsd-tools.cjs` (`migrate` command, `hook` handlers for session-start / pre-compact / post-tool-use, `checkpoint` command, `write-phase-memory` command, plugin-root-aware paths).

### Added
- **Upstream v1.39.0 source-tree changes** — full tree-copy of `workflows/` (78 → 85 top-level workflow bodies), `references/`, `templates/`, `contexts/`, `bin/lib/*.cjs`, and `bin/gsd-tools.cjs`. Notable upstream additions surfaced via the sync:
  - **`--minimal` install profile** — ~94% cold-start token reduction for local LLMs (32K–128K context), writes only main-loop core skills (upstream #2762).
  - **`/gsd:edit-phase`** — modify any roadmap phase field in place without renumbering (upstream #2617).
  - **Post-merge build & test gate** — execute-phase auto-detects build/test commands across Xcode, Make, Just, Cargo, Go, Python, npm; iOS projects run `xcodebuild` automatically (upstream #2720).
  - **Per-runtime review models** — `review.models.<cli>` config + extended `RUNTIME_PROFILE_MAP` covering `gemini`, `qwen`, `opencode`, `copilot` (upstream #2612, #2748).
  - **Workstream config inheritance** — root `.planning/config.json` deep-merged into each workstream config; explicit `null` overrides parent (upstream #2714).
  - **Skill-surface consolidation** — upstream collapsed 86 → 59 skill entries via four new grouped skills (`capture`, `phase`, `config`, `workspace`) and six parents absorbing sub-operations as flags. The plugin still ships 82 `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` files because `skills/` is not in the tree-copy scope (the plugin owns the slash-command surface; upstream's `commands/gsd/*` consolidation is informational here).
- See full upstream release notes: <https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/releases/tag/v1.39.0>.

### Changed
- **Version bump** — plugin `2.38.8 → 2.39.0` per `plugin_major = upstream_major + 1` versioning (README § Versioning).
- **README counts** — workflow bodies `78 → 85`, agent definitions `21 → 33` (post-sync `agents/` count corrected). Slash commands stays at 82 (`skills/` not in tree-copy scope).

### Fixed
- **`MODEL_ALIAS_MAP.opus` no longer needs a plugin patch** — upstream caught up (`MODEL_ALIAS_MAP` and `RUNTIME_PROFILE_MAP.claude.opus` updated to `claude-opus-4-7` in upstream #2733). Our patch was previously the only way the plugin pinned the right model ID; now it's parity with upstream and the patch is structurally identical.

## [2.38.8] - 2026-04-27  (based on upstream GSD 1.38.3)

Plugin-only feature release — adds scheduled-resume support and surfaces plugin-only features more prominently in the README.

### Added
- **`/gsd:resume-at <time>` skill** — schedule a future Claude Code session to auto-run `/gsd:resume-work` (or any GSD command via `--cmd`) at a specific time. Accepts `HH:MM` (today/tomorrow), ISO 8601, or `+<duration>` (`+30m`, `+2h`, `+1d`). Thin wrapper over Claude Code's built-in `/schedule` / `CronCreate` primitive — durability is owned by the host CLI; the skill translates GSD-flavored input. Default scheduled command is `/gsd:resume-work` so HANDOFF.json restores context automatically when the future session opens. Use case: hitting a usage cap, pausing for the day, or queuing a phase to run during off-peak quota windows (quick task `260427-rat`).
- **README "Added features beyond upstream" section** — surfaces plugin-only features above the fold in a single scannable table: scheduled resume, auto-resume across `/compact`, mid-session checkpoints, plugin-version churn fallback, drift detection, 92% token reduction, plugin-local workflow bodies, standardized continuation prompts, and cross-session memory. Replaces buried context in the deep-dive comparison tables for fresh visitors.

### Changed
- **README slash-command count**: 81 → 82 (added `resume-at`).

## [2.38.7] - 2026-04-25  (based on upstream GSD 1.38.3)

Plugin-only patch — closes a real read-heavy-session checkpoint gap surfaced by a usage-cap incident, plus a fuller README comparison vs upstream.

### Fixed
- **PostToolUse periodic checkpoint now covers read-heavy research sessions.** Yesterday's matcher (`Bash|Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit`) only fired on file-mutating tool calls. A real research-phase session in another project hit a usage cap with the last checkpoint written 18 minutes earlier — those 18 minutes were almost entirely `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `WebFetch` calls. None in the matcher → PostToolUse never fired → no checkpoint. Matcher broadened to `Bash|Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit|Read|Grep|Glob|WebFetch|WebSearch`. Combined with the existing 60s mtime throttle, write rate stays bounded (≤1/min regardless of how often the hook fires). Smoke-tested under burst load (5 rapid reads → 1 write). Token cost: zero — verified in CC source that PostToolUse hook output is never injected into model context (quick task `260425-rgw`, commit `7497cc6`).

### Changed
- **README "What changed from upstream GSD"** expanded from a single 6-row table to four grouped tables — Install + runtime architecture, Session continuity, Drift resilience, Plugin-environment robustness. Surfaces the v1.1, v1.2, and v2.38.x improvements that previously weren't documented as user-facing differences.

## [2.38.6] - 2026-04-25  (based on upstream GSD 1.38.3)

Plugin-only patch — closes the largest deferred drift category from v1.2 Phase 7.

### Fixed
- **Workflow `@`-includes now resolve.** Skills delegate to operational logic via `@`-include of workflow body files. Previously these used the legacy non-plugin install path (`@~/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/<name>.md`), which doesn't exist for plugin users — visible to users as a "Falling back to legacy workflow file" graceful-degradation message and silently lost workflow content. v1.2's file-layout detector quantified the impact at 71 dangling refs (Category B) and explicitly deferred the fix as structural. This release ships the fix in two moves:
  - **Plugin-local `workflows/` dir** — 78 workflow markdown files copied from upstream `get-shit-done/workflows/` into the plugin tree, namespace-rewritten to colon-form commands.
  - **Path rewrite to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` form** — 270 `@`-include rewrites across 99 files: `@~/.claude/get-shit-done/<sub>` → `@${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/<sub>` for `workflows/`, `references/`, `templates/`, `contexts/`. Claude Code's plugin loader substitutes `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in skill/agent content (verified via `_research/claude-code-internals/utils/plugins/pluginOptionsStorage.ts`); at runtime the variable expands to the version-stamped install path so the include resolves to the real plugin file.

  Net: **genuinely-missing dangling refs go from 71 → 0**. Skills now load their workflow bodies as intended (quick task `260425-wfd`).

### Changed
- **`bin/maintenance/check-file-layout.cjs`** detector extended with a third reference pattern for `@${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/<sub>` so the new plugin-local form is validated and future drift in it is caught.
- **`tests/drift-baseline.json`** regenerated: was `109 / 38 / 71` (total / repairable / missing); now `122 / 122 / 0`. Total goes UP because the detector now catches the new resolvable refs; missing goes to ZERO.
- **`.planning/PROJECT.md` "After each upstream GSD sync" checklist** step 1 now includes copying `get-shit-done/workflows/` into `workflows/` so future syncs keep workflow bodies in lockstep with upstream.
- **`README.md` "What GSD Plugin provides"** lists the new `78 workflow bodies` entry.

## [2.38.5] - 2026-04-25  (based on upstream GSD 1.38.3)

Plugin-only patch — two follow-ups to v1.2's session-continuity work, plus an audit-doc fix.

### Added
- **PostToolUse periodic checkpoint** — bridges Claude Code's *microcompact* gap. CC has two compaction paths (verified in `_research/claude-code-internals/services/compact/`): full `compactConversation` (fires PreCompact → plugin checkpoints) and `microcompactMessages` (per-turn lossy GC of stale tool outputs; **does NOT fire PreCompact**, no event hookable). New `post-tool-use` handler in `bin/gsd-tools.cjs` writes a fresh `HANDOFF.json` after any file-mutating tool call (matcher: `Bash|Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit`), throttled by HANDOFF.json mtime to at most once per 60s. New `source: "auto-postool"` value in the schema enum. Net: `HANDOFF.json` is at most ~60s stale during an active session regardless of which compaction path ran (quick task `260425-mct`).
- **`/clear` continuation hints surfaced at end-of-flow boundaries** — six terminal skills (`execute-phase`, `complete-milestone`, `verify-work`, `quick`, `plan-phase`, `ship`) now emit a `## ▶ Next Up` continuation block following `references/continuation-format.md` when the workflow concludes. Each block includes the standard `` `/clear` then [next-command] `` pattern plus a parenthetical explaining that `/clear` is safe (resume-work restores from HANDOFF.json since v1.1's session continuity work). Closes the dormant-template gap — `references/continuation-format.md` was rich but unused (quick task `260425-clr`).

### Changed
- **`bin/lib/checkpoint.cjs`** — `generateCheckpoint` accepts `auto-postool` as a third source value; status mapping treats both `auto-compact` and `auto-postool` as `auto-checkpoint`. Doc comment updated.
- **`schema/handoff-v1.json`** — `source` enum extended from `["auto-compact", "manual-pause"]` to `["auto-compact", "manual-pause", "auto-postool"]` with a `$comment` describing each value.
- **`hooks/hooks.json`** — PostToolUse matcher: `Bash` → `Bash|Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit`.
- **`references/continuation-format.md`** — top-of-file safety footer documents that `/clear` is safe since v1.1's session-continuity work; gives the standard "/clear is safe" parenthetical wording as a single source of truth.

### Fixed
- **`.planning/AUDIT-v1.2.md` self-collision** — the v1.2 milestone audit's own "Plan self-collision" lesson contained a literal dash-form `/gsd-<real-skill-name>` example, tripping the namespace drift detector. Rephrased to a generic placeholder.

## [2.38.4] - 2026-04-24  (based on upstream GSD 1.38.3)

v1.2 Upstream Resilience shipment. Full context in [milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md](.planning/milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md).

### Added
- **Unified drift check orchestrator** — `bin/maintenance/check-drift.cjs` runs the file-layout, HANDOFF schema, and namespace drift detectors in sequence and reports a consolidated verdict. Intended for local dev loops and post-upstream-sync verification. Offline-deterministic (upstream-schema detector kept separate per v1.2 Phase 9 design). Closes DRIFT-03 (v1.2 Phase 9).
- **README feature tour** for session continuity and drift resilience — new `## Session continuity + drift resilience` section. Two-paragraph prose describing the `/compact` round-trip (PreCompact hook → HANDOFF.json → SessionStart auto-resume → handoff cleanup) and the three-detector CI gate with ratchet baselines plus the post-sync upstream-schema detector. Closes DOCS-01 (v1.2 Phase 9).
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — this file. Keep-a-Changelog format with plugin-vs-upstream version distinction in section headers. Closes DOCS-02 (v1.2 Phase 9).

### Changed
- **`.planning/PROJECT.md` post-sync checklist** — formalized nine-step sequence including a dedicated CHANGELOG update step, the unified `check-drift.cjs` gate ("must exit 0 before declaring sync complete"), and the separate `check-upstream-schema.cjs` step for upstream schema drift. Closes MAINT-01 (v1.2 Phase 9).
- **README reorganized for new-user-first flow** — install / quick start / updating / maintenance scripts now run contiguously at the top; upstream-user migration content consolidated into a trailing `## For users of upstream GSD` umbrella; versioning section demoted from top to meta. No content deletions (quick task 260421-rnu).

### Fixed
- **Skill command-ID duplication** — renamed all 81 skill directories from `skills/gsd-<name>/` → `skills/<name>/`. Previously Claude Code derived command IDs from the directory basename and prepended the plugin name (`gsd`), producing `/gsd:gsd-<name>` while the tab-completion menu displayed `/gsd:<name>` (from the frontmatter `name:` field). Dir rename unifies display and inserted forms. Also aligns plugin layout with upstream's `commands/gsd/<name>.md` structure — future syncs map 1:1 without a basename-rewriting step (quick task 260424-srn).

## [2.38.3] - 2026-04-21  (based on upstream GSD 1.38.3)

### Added
- **File-layout drift detector** (`bin/maintenance/check-file-layout.cjs`) — scans plugin content for dangling `@~/.claude/get-shit-done/*` references, classifies as repairable (has plugin counterpart) vs genuinely missing, compares counts against `tests/drift-baseline.json` ratchet, exits 0/1/2 per maintenance convention. Runs in CI on every push and pull request (first job of `.github/workflows/check-drift.yml`). Closes DRIFT-01 and the file-layout portion of DRIFT-02 (Phase 7).
- **Committed HANDOFF schema baseline** (`schema/handoff-v1.json`) — JSON Schema draft-07 describing the 19-field HANDOFF.json contract (17 required upstream-compat fields + 2 optional plugin-only fields). Fixture at `schema/fixtures/handoff-sample.json`. Closes SCHEMA-01 (Phase 8).
- **HANDOFF schema validator** (`bin/maintenance/check-handoff-schema.cjs`) — runs `writeCheckpoint()` in an isolated tmp dir and validates the generated HANDOFF.json against the committed schema via ajv. Cleans up tmp dir in a `finally{}` block (never touches real `.planning/HANDOFF.json`). Runs in CI as the second job of `.github/workflows/check-drift.yml`. Closes SCHEMA-02 (Phase 8).
- **Upstream schema drift detector** (`bin/maintenance/check-upstream-schema.cjs`) — downloads or uses a cached upstream GSD release tarball, extracts the declared `/gsd:pause-work` field list from `workflows/pause-work.md`, and diffs against the committed schema. Not in CI (network-dependent; post-sync-only). Set `UPSTREAM_VERSION=v1.x.y` to target a specific release. Closes SCHEMA-03 (Phase 8).
- **Frontier mode for `/gsd:sketch` and `/gsd:spike`** — running either command with no argument (or `frontier`) now analyzes the existing sketch/spike landscape and proposes consistency/frontier targets instead of requiring an explicit idea (from upstream 1.38.3).
- **Extended tool access** for sketches and spikes — both skills now include `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, and context7 `resolve-library-id` / `query-docs` in allowed-tools, grounding experiments in real API surfaces (from upstream 1.38.3).
- **Second CI job** in `.github/workflows/check-drift.yml` — handoff-schema runs in parallel to file-layout on a separate ubuntu-latest runner with `cache: npm` + `npm ci`. Either regression fails the workflow independently (Phase 8).
- **`ajv` + `ajv-formats` as devDependencies** — first node dev deps on the project. `node_modules/` added to `.gitignore`. `package-lock.json` committed (Phase 8).

### Fixed
- **`bin/maintenance/rewrite-command-namespace.cjs` skip pattern** — generalized from literal `v1.0-` prefix to `v\d+\.` regex so versioned milestone archives (`v1.1-phases/`, future `v1.2-phases/`, …) are preserved as-is on re-runs.

## [2.38.2] - 2026-04-20  (based on upstream GSD 1.38.1)

v1.1 Session Continuity shipment. Full context in [milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md](.planning/milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md).

### Added
- **Session continuity across `/compact`** — PreCompact hook writes `.planning/HANDOFF.json` with current phase, plan, task, and status; SessionStart hook detects the handoff on next session and auto-invokes `/gsd:resume-work` with zero user intervention. Verified end-to-end via live `/compact` UAT on 2026-04-20. Closes CKPT-01/02/03 + RESM-01/02/03 (v1.1 Phase 4).
- **CLAUDE.md `## Session Continuity` section** — hook-independent fallback trigger. Works for CLIs without hook support or when the hook is overridden. Closes BKUP-01/02 (v1.1 Phase 5).
- **Handoff lifecycle cleanup** — `deleteCheckpoint()` helper in `bin/lib/checkpoint.cjs` + `checkpoint --clear` CLI flag. `/gsd:resume-work` removes the handoff after successful resume, preventing phantom resume attempts. Closes LIFE-01 (v1.1 Phase 5).
- **Hook-command version fallback** — `hooks/hooks.json` resolves the newest cached plugin version when the baked `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` path is pruned mid-session (e.g. after an upgrade). Keeps long sessions working across plugin updates (v1.1 quick task 260420-vfb).
- **Namespace normalization** — 273 `/gsd-<skill>` dash-style refs rewritten to `/gsd:<skill>` across 100 files, plus a durable maintenance script for post-sync re-runs. Closes the "Unknown command: /gsd-foo" failure mode inherited from upstream's un-namespaced command form (v1.1 quick task 260420-cns).
