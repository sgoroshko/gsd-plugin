# Weekly self-update watch for the gsd-plugin install.
#
# Claude Code's plugin auto-update is unreliable, so this notifier compares the
# INSTALLED plugin version (highest version present in the Claude Code plugin
# cache) against the latest jnuyens/gsd-plugin GitHub release, and emails only
# when the install is actually BEHIND. Intended to run weekly from cron.
#
# Never fails cron: every external step is guarded with `|| exit 0`, and a
# missing cache / offline state exits 0 silently. First run seeds without email.
